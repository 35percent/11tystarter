The Bermondsey One Stop Shop was a council office located next to the former library on Spa Road. Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=118&MID=2832#AI4795) to sell the building and surrounding land in September 2009. It was subsequently sold to developers in 2012 and is currently being redeveloped.
