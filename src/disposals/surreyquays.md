In 2015 Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s57868/Report%20Canada%20Water%20Regeneration.pdf) to sell a 999 year lease of its freehold interest in Surrey Quays shopping centre and adjacent print works site to developer British Land (see above shopping centre shaded orange and print works shaded green).

In 2019 Southwark granted planning permission to the developer for up to 4,000 new homes. Only the first phase of the scheme will provide 35% affordable housing. Remaining phases will be subject to viability.

Southwark's development agreement with British Land was published [following an FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/partnership_agreement_for_redeve?unfold=1#incoming-1281908) but has been heavily redacted.

Almost the entire section on affordable housing has been redacted:
