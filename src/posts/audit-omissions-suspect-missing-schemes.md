## 04/AP/2114 (Garland Court, Wansey Street)
31 flats approved, of which 16 social rent, 3 shared ownership and 12 private sale.
However, [LR records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=garland+court&postcode=se17+1lh&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=wansey&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction) show that 22 flats in Garland Court have come up as having been sold.
That's 7 more homes sold privately than there should be..
I think we might be onto something here, especially given that it was council land given at nil cost to the housing association to provide replacement homes for Heygate tenants.
Also the housing association (Southern Housing) is now Optivo - one of our baddies!

## 12/AP/1630
It's a former council owned pub on a council estate in Dulwich, the pub was called the Oriwiu Spot and was sold in 2011 to a developer for Â£200k.
They then obtained permission in Nov 2012 for 20 new homes of which 5 affordable (shared ownership).
[LR records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=67&postcode=SE5+8jz&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=green+dale+&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction&town=London) suggest no involvement of a housing association. Download freehold title to check!
The 5 shared ownership homes (flats 1-5) are on the ground floor and were each fully staircased within a year.
It's LDHA all over again - this time without the involvement of a housing association!
PS. the developer involved (Leaf Lane LLP) was dissolved two years ago!
