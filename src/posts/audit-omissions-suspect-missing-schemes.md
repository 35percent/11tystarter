## 12/AP/2859 (originally pub at 171 Long Lane)
117 Weston Street, SE1 4GR
19 units, all sold open market. Should have been 6 shared ownership.

Former pub Valentine and Orson on Kipling estate - council owned?

All sales look at market value, no restrictive covenants on any of the units. No staircasing sales.
Developer - Robert Copper

## 06/AP/2341
See attached Land Registry docs for 814 Old Kent Road.
Looks like there are 21 flats instead of the 20 consented.
Looks like they were all sold as shared equity and have all been staircased with the exception of one or two homes.
Housing association is A2Dominion.

## 04/AP/2114 (Garland Court, Wansey Street)
31 flats approved, of which 16 social rent, 3 shared ownership and 12 private sale.
However, [LR records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=garland+court&postcode=se17+1lh&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=wansey&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction) show that 22 flats in Garland Court have come up as having been sold.
That's 7 more homes sold privately than there should be..
I think we might be onto something here, especially given that it was council land given at nil cost to the housing association to provide replacement homes for Heygate tenants.
Also the housing association (Southern Housing) is now Optivo - one of our baddies!
