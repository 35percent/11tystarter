Confidential note on Aylesbury disrepair						12 Aug 2025

1	In July 2022 ward Cllr KH emailed Council repairs about a leak from above, on behalf of a secure council tenant living in Latimer, on the Aylesbury estate.  The tenant’s flat had leaks into several rooms.  It was a longstanding problem and previous repairs to damage had not resolved the issue.  (Email, with nine images, to Member Enquiries cc Cllr Merrill and Repairs, 01 July 2022).

2	Cllr KH says that no meaningful work was carried out in response to her email and that the Leaks from Above (LFA) team said it was unable to gain access to the upper-floor flat. 

3	In April 2023 Cllr SF visited both flats; he gained access to the upper-floor flat easily.  He took a photo of upper flat and a video of the lower flat.  He emailed senior officers, Cllr Merrill cc the LFA team and some fellow councillors.  The upper floor resident was a vulnerable adult in need of support.  His bathroom was the source of the longstanding leaks.  The living conditions were ‘inhumane’.  Cllr KH had raised the issue the previous year, but the long-term problem had been ‘allowed to fester’ further. Cllr SF finishes email by asking for an investigation into what had been done since Cllr KH first raised the issue the previous year. (Email 27 April 2023)

4	A Stage 2 Complaint report by the Customer Resolution Team (CST), in relation to a complaint made by Cllr SF on behalf of the tenant of the lower floor flat, also partially addresses his request for an investigation.  The report, as related in a letter to the tenant, says the CST is restricted in what it can say about the upper-floor property and tenant.

5	The report says that a response was sent to Cllr KH on 27 July 2022, advising that a Technical Quality Officer (TQO) was to visit the flooded flat and an appointment had been made to replace the toilet.  An initial inspection request had been made on 01 July and took place on 14 July; evidence of leaks was found and referred to the LFA team.  The LFA unsuccessfully sought entry to the upper-floor flat between 19 and 27 July.  The report says that the LFA team went to the wrong flat.

6	The report continues that a new repair job for the ongoing leak was raised on 29 July; the LFA team attended on 01 Aug, but were unable to do any work in the absence of a referral from the Resident Services Team (RST).  The report says that it was ‘unable to provide any detailed information regarding the actions taken since this time’ with no explanation as to why.

7	The report states that another job was then raised on 20 January 2023, to redecorate the kitchen ceiling of the flat, but on 10 Feb it was flooded again, before this could be done.  A request to the LFA team again could not be actioned without a referral to the RST. 

8	A further report was made to the Resident Services Officer (RSO) on 20 April 2023 and that the tenant was offered temporary accommodation, which they refused.

9	An ‘out of hours’ job was raised on 22 April, but entry got not be gained.  The electrics were made safe on 24 April and the leak stopped on 28 April 2023.

10	In summary the report says;

i/ a council officer inspected the flooded flat two weeks after Cllr KH referred the repair to Member’s Enquiries

ii/ the inspection reported upstairs leaks to the LFA team, who tried to gain access to the upstairs flat from five days after the inspection, but gave up after a further eight days; access could not be gained because the LFA went to the wrong flat

iii/ the LFA attended the flooded flat again 5 days after giving up on getting access to the upstairs flat, but did no work, because there had been no referral to the RST (01 Aug 2022)

iv/ there was then no further action for nearly 6 months, until a new job was raised to redecorate the flooded flat (20 Jan 2023).  The report says it cannot explain why there was this delay

v/ three weeks later the flat was flooded again, before the redecoration could be done.  A request was again made to the LFA team, but they could do nothing, because there was no referral to the RST.  A referral was made to the Resident Services Officer the same day, who offered the tenant temporary accommodation, which they refused

vi/ two days later an ‘out of hours’ job was raised, but entry could not be gained to the flat. 

vii/ two days after that the electrics were made secure and four days later the leak stopped.

11	The report upholds the complaint and finds that the leak had not been ‘followed-up’ as it should have been.  The tenant is awarded compensation at a rate of £20pw, for the period from 01 July 2022 (date of Cllr KH’s email) to 28 April 2023 (date the leak stopped).  After discounting 4 weeks as a ‘reasonable turnaround period’ this amounted to 39 weeks, yielding £780 compensation.  The report advises the tenant that this is the Council’s final decision and that they can refer the matter to the Housing Ombudsman if dissatisfied. (Stage 2 Complaint report, ref 14172965, 11 Aug 2025).

12	The report does not say if the tenant still resides in the flat.  Cllr KH believes she has been satisfactorily rehoused elsewhere.

13	The Stage 2 Complaint report relates only to the flooded flat; it gives no information about what has happened to the upper-floor property and its tenant, and it makes no judgements about any repairs there.

14	The ward councillors do not know what the situation of the upper-floor tenant is.

15	The ward councillors know of other instances of unattended leaks from above.  Two households in Latimer had to move out because of such leaks; they were satisfactorily rehoused elsewhere.  The councillors did not know if the premises were now habitable. 

16	Cllr KH is a resident of Latimer (tenure?). Latimer is in Phase 4 of the planned regeneration.  It is structurally sound and will undoubtedly be in occupation for many years.

17	The councillors compiled a dossier of Aylesbury disrepairs, including a video and image of the instance noted here, and submitted this to the council leadership.

18	The Aylesbury Estate Voids and Squatted Property Data is compiled by the contractor for renovating properties.  It has been shared with councillors, but does not appear to be a public document.
