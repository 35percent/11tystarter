#### Lawfulness of latest phase of troubled regeneration to be tested

The legal challenge against Southwark Council’s decision to approve the latest phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment will be heard in the High Court in the Strand next Tuesday 28 November.

The challenge is being brought by long-term Aylesbury resident and [housing campaigner Aysen Dennis](https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/southwark/aylesbury-estate-residents-legal-battle-with-southwark-council-edges-closer/) and relates to Phase 2B.  Aysen is being represented by the [Public Interest Law Centre (PILC)](https://www.pilc.org.uk/gentrification-project/) and barrister [Alex Shuttock of Landmark Chambers](https://www.landmarkchambers.co.uk/barristers/alex-shattock). 

#### A tale of two planning permissions

NHG made an application for Phase 2B last year and it was [approved, subject to legal agreement](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7308), in January 2023.  However, NHG already had a [different planning permission](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=4808&Ver=4) for the whole of the estate, including Phase 2B, dating from 2015.  This would not have permitted, amongst other things, the construction of the new 25 storey tower which the new permission would have allowed.  Campaigners fear that the new permission opens the door to the 2015 outline planning permission for the whole estate being abandoned.  These fears have grown with the recent revelation that [Southwark intended to take over the whole estate’s regeneration](https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/walworth/exclusive-southwark-council-planned-to-take-over-2000-aylesbury-estate-homes-from-developer/) from NHG, but then concluded it did not have the resources to do so.

#### Less social rented housing

The case has generated national publicity.  In a [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/09/london-estate-resident-goes-to-high-court-over-demolition-plans) Saskia O’Hara, from PILC, referred to a recent [supreme court decision](<recent supreme court decision>) on this issue, and said: *“It is already difficult for communities to play a meaningful role in the planning process, and this is never truer than for a resident of a London estate which has been a target for demolition by councils and private developers over decades. Developers should not be able to sidestep the findings of the supreme court and have a free pass to change what was promised to residents in the historic planning permission.”* 

The Guardian article also points out that there would be a reduction in social rented housing, if the new planning permission for Phase 2B is allowed to go ahead.  At the moment, there are 327 social rented homes on the site, plus 46 sold under right to buy.  NHG proposes replacing them with 614 new homes in total, but only 163 would be socially rented.

#### Aylesbury campaigners mobilise

[Fight4Aylesbury](https://twitter.com/Aylesbury_exhib) campaigners believe that there is now a fresh opportunity to shape the future of the Aylesbury.  They want a decent deal for all residents on the Aylesbury and believe that the best deal involves retaining current precious homes.  They point out the CO2 impact of demolition is huge and make a four-point proposal;

•	Invest in and improve the buildings we already have

•	Insulate, retrofit and refurbish
