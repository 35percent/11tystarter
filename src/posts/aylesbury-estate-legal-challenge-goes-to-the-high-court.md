#### Lawfulness of latest phase of troubled regeneration to be tested

The legal challenge against Southwark Council’s decision to approve the latest phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment will be heard in the High Court in the Strand next Tuesday 28 November.

The challenge is being brought by long-term Aylesbury resident and [housing campaigner Aysen Dennis](https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/southwark/aylesbury-estate-residents-legal-battle-with-southwark-council-edges-closer/) and relates to Phase 2B.  Aysen is being represented by the [Public Interest Law Centre (PILC)](https://www.pilc.org.uk/gentrification-project/) and barrister [Alex Shuttock of Landmark Chambers](https://www.landmarkchambers.co.uk/barristers/alex-shattock). 

#### A tale of two planning permissions

NHG made an application for Phase 2B last year and it was [approved, subject to legal agreement](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7308), in January 2023.  However, NHG already had a different planning permission for the whole of the estate, including Phase 2B, dating from 2015.  This would not have permitted, amongst other things, the construction of the new 25 storey tower which the new permission would have allowed.  Campaigners fear that the new permission opens the door to the 2015 outline planning permission for the whole estate being abandoned.  These fears have grown with the recent revelation that Southwark intended to take over the whole estate’s regeneration from NHG, but then concluded it did not have the resources to do so.
