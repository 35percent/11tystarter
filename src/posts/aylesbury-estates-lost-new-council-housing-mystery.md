Southwark’s planning committee has approved 357 social rented homes for the Aylesbury estate’s First Development Site, xxx less than the 581 social rented homes promised, nearly two years ago, in July 2020.  All the social rented homes were to be ‘new council homes at council rents on secure lifetime tenancies’, according to the Cabinet report which agreed the deal.
