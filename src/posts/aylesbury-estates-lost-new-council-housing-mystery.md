Just before Christmas Southwark’s planning committee approved 357 social rented homes for the Aylesbury estate’s First Development Site, 224 fewer than the 581 social rented homes promised, nearly two years ago, in July 2020.  All the social rented homes were to be ‘new council homes at council rents on secure lifetime tenancies’, according to the[ Cabinet report ](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf)which agreed the proposal.

The First Development Site (FDS) was to have been developed by Notting Hill Genesis (NHG), under a planning [permission granted in 2014](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=35877), for 830 residential units, including 304 social rented units.  This was increased to 842 units, including 348 social rent units [in 2018](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s78337/ITEM%207.1%207.2%20-%20REPORT%2017AP3885%2017AP3846.pdf).
