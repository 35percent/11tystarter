Southwark Council’s planning committee finally passed Notting Hill Genesis’ troubled planning application for the latest phase of the Aylesbury regeneration bu 6 votes to one, at its 4 June meeting.

The Phase 2B application was [first considered in January 2023](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7308&Ver=4), when the committee resolved to approve, but a [successful legal challenge](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ayllesbury-planning-decision-quashed/) by local resident Aysen Dennis prevented the grant of a full permission.  Phase 2B  covers about half of the Aylesbury’s largest block, Wendover, and adjacent maisonette blocks, Padbury, Ravenstone,and Winslow.

The committee considered an amended version of the scheme, which increased the total number of homes by twenty six units, to 640, and added one-storey to four buildings, with a maximum height of 26 storeys.  The resolution to approve will now have to be finalised by a completed legal s106 agreement, between Southwark and NHG.

#### More or less social rented housing?

Phase 2B will have 50% affordable housing, with three-quarters of this as social rent, so delivering 173 social rent, 89 intermediate and 378 private homes.  Despite this, here will nonetheless be a net loss of 143 social rented units, measured against the 316 council houses that are to be demolished \[x].   

The committee was told that while there was a net loss of social rent units, there was an increase of social rented accommodation when measured by habitable room and floorspace and that this conformed to the London Mayor’s requirement that there be no shortfall in social rented housing.

This was challanged by objectors from Fight4Aylesbury and in an objection letter, the Southwark Law Centre also said that the size of some of the existing dwellings and the average of habitable rooms per unit had been underestimated.  SLC also queried the omission from existing floorspace of the homes of Foxcote, a maisonette block that was demolished in 2016.  In response the Council reduced its estimate of the 'uplift' of new affordable floorspace, but maintained that it still met the Mayor's requirements.  The Council also believed that omitting Foxcote from the calculations was correct, because it was demolished before the current application was submitted.

\[x] There are 373 existing homes; the committee report gives two different figures for the number of existing social rent units 327 (para 35) and 316 (para 101).  The 316 figure has been used to calculate the loss of social rent, but whichever figure is used remainding homes will be leasehold.
