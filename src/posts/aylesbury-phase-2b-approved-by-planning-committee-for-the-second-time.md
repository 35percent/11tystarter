Southwark Council’s planning committee finally passed Notting Hill Genesis’ troubled planning application for the latest phase of the Aylesbury regeneration by 6 votes to one, at its 4 June meeting.  The resolution to approve will now have to be finalised by a completed legal s106 agreement, between Southwark and NHG.

The Phase 2B application was [first considered in January 2023](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7308&Ver=4), when the committee resolved to approve, but a [successful legal challenge](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ayllesbury-planning-decision-quashed/) by local resident Aysen Dennis prevented the grant of a full permission.  Phase 2B  covers about half of the Aylesbury’s largest block, Wendover, and adjacent maisonette blocks, Padbury, Ravenstone,and Winslow.

The committee considered an amended version of the scheme, which increased the total number of homes by twenty six units, to 640, and added one-storey to four buildings, with a maximum height of 26 storeys.  NHG stated that these changes were necessary because of  new building safety requirements, including a second staircase in tall buildings.  The [application remained a 'standalone'](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-estate-legal-challenge-goes-to-the-high-court/) or 'drop-in' application, outside the Outline Planning Permission, which NHG already holds.  

#### More or less social rented housing?

Phase 2B will have 50% affordable housing, three-quarters as social rent, so delivering 173 social rent, 89 intermediate and 378 private homes.  Despite this, there will still be a net loss of 143 social rented units, measured against the 316 council houses that are to be demolished \[x].   

The committee was told that while there was a net loss of social rent units, there was an increase of social rented accommodation, when measured by habitable room and floorspace and that this conformed to the London Mayor’s requirement that there be no shortfall in social rented housing.

This was challanged by objectors, Fight4Aylesbury.  The Southwark Law Centre also said that the size of some of the existing dwellings and the average of habitable rooms per unit had been underestimated.  [SLC also queried](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/7A2D6171119C937B95CB751E37AD25A8/pdf/22_AP_2226-OBJECTION-4068338.pdf) the omission from existing floorspace of the homes of Foxcote, a maisonette block that was demolished in 2016.  In response the Council reduced its estimate of the 'uplift' of new affordable floorspace, but maintained that it still met the Mayor's requirements.  The Council also believed that omitting Foxcote from the calculations was correct, because it was demolished before the current application was submitted.

#### More or less sustainable?

Fight4Aylesbury objectors challanged the sustainability of the proposed scheme. A request to make a presentation of an [alternative refurbishment scheme](https://www.little-ships.org/locations/southwark/aylesbury-estate/), devised by the Community Interest Company, [Little Ships](https://www.little-ships.org/) was refused, on the grounds that the committee can only consider schemes as presented by the applicant.  However, the chair did allow some discussion of the relative merits of demolition verses refurbishment, including committe members questioning both objectors and NHG on the respective merits of demolition versus refurbishment.   Amongst other things, objectors pointed to the carbon emissions entailed in demolishing the estate’s large concrete panelled buildings, while NHG contended that emissions will still be reduced to levels beyond that required by building regulations.

#### Ward councillors decline to support NHG application

Cllr Ketzia Harper, representing the local ward councillors, was fiercely critical of NHG and the slow progress of the regeneration under their stewardship.  She related to the committee details of the Aylesbury's deteriorating physical condition. and the poor living conditions that this was creating for the residents still on the estate.  She forcefully rebuttted NHG's claim that it had delivered 1,000 new homes to date, pointing out that the stalled First Development Site had to be facilitated[ by the Council buying over half the stock](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-07-09-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/), and reiterated concerns about the height of the development and the replacement of the social rented housing. 

Cllr Harper also spoke of worries about the knock-on effect of continuing with the 'standalone' application for Phase 2B, outside of the Outline Planning Permission; she noted that this had already occassioned a successful legal challange and was concerned that this may happen again.  Cllr Harper said that the new Bagshot St park was a positive.  When asked by the committee whether she was for or against the application, she said she could not answer, that she was giving evidence for the committee to decide.  She also wished for the relationship between Southwark and NHG to be resolved.

#### Legal advice reassures committee



\[x] There are 373 existing homes; the committee report gives two different figures for the number of existing social rent units 327 (para 35) and 316 (para 101).  The 316 figure has been used to calculate the loss of social rent, but whichever figure is used remainding homes will be leasehold.
