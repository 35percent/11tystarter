Southwark Council’s planning committee finally passed Notting Hill Genesis’ troubled planning application for the latest phase of the Aylesbury regeneration on Wednesday evening, by a 6 votes to one.

The application for Phase 2B, which covers about half of the Aylesbury’s largest block, Wendover and adjacent maisonettes, Padbury and ……..was first considered by the committee in January 2023.  On that occasion the committee resolved to approve the application, but a successful legal challenge by local resident Aysen Dennis prevented the grant of a full permission.
