Southwark Council’s planning committee finally passed Notting Hill Genesis’ troubled planning application for the latest phase of the Aylesbury regeneration bu 6 votes to one, at its 4 June meeting.

The Phase 2B application was [first considered in January 2023](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7308&Ver=4), when the committee resolved to approve, but a [successful legal challenge](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ayllesbury-planning-decision-quashed/) by local resident Aysen Dennis prevented the grant of a full permission.  Phase 2B  covers about half of the Aylesbury’s largest block, Wendover, and adjacent maisonette blocks, Padbury, Ravenstone,and Winslow.

The committee considered an amended version of the scheme, which increased the total number of homes by twenty six units, to 640, and added one-storey to four buildings, with a maximum height of 26 storeys.  The resolution to approve will now have to be finalised by a completed legal s106 agreement, between Southwark and NHG
