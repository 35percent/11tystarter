#### £0 for the land, but still not financially viable



The updated proposal is larger than the original in response to updated fire regulations which require changes, such as extra staircases in four of the blocks, which reduce the amount of residential floorspace.  Extra floors have been added to compensate, taking the total number of new homes to 640.

NHG say that this is *'to ensure the scheme viably delivers the required affordable homes'* [^1].  An updated viability assessment for the scheme concludes the opposite, saying *'the appraisals generate a viability deficit of c. £24.16m'.*  It continues, saying that *'if the deficit were to be absorbed by the Applicant's target return, the equivalent profit would equate to 5.22% on GDV (blended)'*.  This is the Gross Development Value on the combined worth of the private and affordable housing and commercial premises.  In cash terms, this means that, even though the scheme is deemed unviable, it will make a profit of £13.51m (5.5% on a GDV of £258.76m).  

The assessment makes a cautious caveat that should both sales values and costs improve by around 5%, then the scheme would become viable, which means it could generate a much higher profit of 14.55% of GDV.  The viability assessment also sets the benchmark land value at £0, *'based on the development agreement between NHG and LB Southwark'*, which indicates that nothing has been paid for the land.

#### The Mayor mends NHG's profit

The updated viability assessment has been submitted to take account of the physical changes to the scheme, such as the second staircases.  A comparison with the original assessment shows that NHG's profit level appears to have fallen from 12.27% (GDV £244.44m), to 5.5% (GDV of £258.76m) - in cash terms falling from £29.94m to £13.51m, a drop of £16.43m.

The viability assessments also show, though, that the Mayor's GLA Affordable Housing Grant has increased from £28.79m to £42.51m - an increase of £13.72m, leaving the net drop at £2.71m.
