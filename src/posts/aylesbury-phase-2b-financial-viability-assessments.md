#### New viability assessment shows £13.5m profit

Notting Hill Genesis' (NHG) [second attempt at getting full planning permission](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-phase-2b-notting-hill-genesis-try-again/) for the Phase 2B of the Aylesbury regeneration stands to make a £13.5m profit.  This is according to a new viability assessment submitted by NHG in support of their updated planning application.  NHG's first attempt was approved by Southwark's planning committee in January 2023, but made no further progress, after getting entangled in a [successful High Court challenge](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ayllesbury-planning-decision-quashed/) by local resident and campaigner Aysen Dennis.

NHG's updated application takes account of new requirements for a second staircase in tall buildings and other safety measures.  Extra floors have been added to compensate for lost residential floorspace in seven of the eleven buildings, which will be between five and ten storeys, with one tower of 26 storeys.  The number of homes will increase from 614 to 640, with an increase in the number of social rented homes (163 to 173) and of intermediate part-buy/part-let homes (82 to 89). The number of private homes has been increased to 378 from 369.  

#### £0 for the land, but still not financially viable

While the updated Phase 2B should make at least £13.5m profit, NHG say that it is still not viable, despite gaining revenue from the extra floors [^1].  The  updated viability assessment for the scheme concludes *'the appraisals generate a viability deficit of c. £24.16m'.*  It goes on to say that *'if the deficit were to be absorbed by the Applicant's* \[NHG] *target return, the equivalent profit would equate to 5.22% on GDV (blended)'*.  This 'Gross Development Value' is the combined worth of all the housing and commercial premises and amounts to £258.76m.  So, even though the scheme is *'unviable'*, it is still expected to make a profit of around £13.5m (5.22% of £258.76m).

According to this line of thinking, while there is the £13.5m profit, this is still a *'viability deficit'*.  NHG says of the profit that *'This is lower than typical target thresholds for schemes of this size and also below any of the thresholds adopted/ accepted for other estate regeneration schemes across London'* [^2].

The assessment makes the cautious caveat that should both sales values and costs improve by around 5%, then the scheme would become viable, which means it could generate a much higher profit of 14.55% of GDV and still provide the 50% affordable housing, as required by the Southwark Plan 2022. 

The viability assessment also sets the benchmark land value at £0, *'based on the development agreement between NHG and LB Southwark'*, which indicates that nothing will be paid for the land.  If NHG had to pay for the land then this would increase the *'viability deficit'* and reduce profit [^3].

#### The Mayor gives an extra £13.72m for 17 units

The updated assessment also shows that the Mayor is giving NHG an extra £13.72m in affordable housing grant, raising it to £42.51m from £28.79m.  The number of affordable units is also rising, but only by 17 units, which means a nominal grant for each additional unit of £807,058 [^4].

Put another way, the average grant for each unit of affordable housing has risen from £115.39k per home to £162.25k per home, which is about a third of the total build cost for an affordable home [^5]

### The Mayor repairs NHG's bottom line?

The extra affordable housing grant also makes for a healthier looking bottom line.  While the updated assessement shows a 5.22% profit on GDV, and is a fall from the original assessment of a 12.27% profit (also said to be unviable by NHG), the fall would be worse without the Mayor's contribution [^6].

In cash terms, the fall in the profit rate for the updated scheme has inceased the 'viability deficit' from around £6.69m to around £24.16m.  The increased Mayor's grant saves a further £13.72m from being added to this deficit.

#### What we say

It's important to remember that a viability deficit is not the same as a loss.  A viability deficit is simply the difference between what a developer wants to make and what they say they will make.

NHG want to make 14.55% (GDV), around £37.65m, on the updated plans for Phase 2B, but say they are only going to make 5.22%, around £13.5m, leaving them with a 'viability deficit' of around £24.16m.  This is still a profit though, of £13.5m, and small changes in sales values could significantly improve this. 

NHG are also benefitting from an increase to their affordable housing grant, which has risen by £13.72m, but with only a small increase in affordable housing, of seventeen 17 units (10 social rent, 7 shared ownership).  NHG are also getting the land for free. 

This does not look like a bad deal for NHG.  

A question also naturally arises as to what eactly the Mayor's affordable housing grant is being spent on, when the rate of grant per unit rises so steeply (by over 40%), while a comparison of the original and updated viability assessments show that total build costs for the scheme have risen by much less -16%.  It's hard not to suspect that the increase has a much to do with maintaining 'viability' as it does with securing more affordable housing.

[^5] The grant for the original proposal was £28.27m for 245 affordable homes - an average cost of £115.39k per home.  The grant for the updated proposal is £42.51m for 262 affordable homes - an average cost of £162.25k per home.   By calculation, using averages, the Mayor's grant is about a third of the cost of the affordable housing - £325,280,540 (total cost) divided by 640= £508.25k av cost per unit; x 262 affordable units = £133.162m; divided by £42.51m = 3.13.  See the Appraisal Summary, Financial Viability Assessment, Sept 2024, pg 137 for total cost figure.
