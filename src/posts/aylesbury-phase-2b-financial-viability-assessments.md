Notting Hill Genesis' (NHG) [second attempt at getting full planning permission](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-phase-2b-notting-hill-genesis-try-again/) for the Phase 2B of the Aylesbury regeneration stands to make a £13.5m profit.  This is according to an viability assessment submitted by NHG in support of their updated planning application.  NHG's first attempt was approved by Southwark's planning committee in January 2023, but made no further progress, after getting entangled in a [successful High Court challenge](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ayllesbury-planning-decision-quashed/) by local resident and campaigner Aysen Dennis (LINK).

NHG's updated application takes account of new requirements for a second staircase in tall buildings and other safety measures.  Extra floors have been added to compensate for lost residential floorspace in seven of the eleven buildings, which will be between five and ten storeys, with one tower of 26 storeys.  The number of homes will increase from 614 to 640, with an increase in the number of social rented homes (163 to 173) and of intermediate part-buy/part-let homes (82 to 89). The number of private homes has been increased to 378 from 369.

#### £0 for the land, but still not financially viable

While the updated Phase 2B should make at least £13.5m profit, NHG say that it is still not viable, despite gaining revenue from the extra floors [^1].  The  updated viability assessment for the scheme concludes *'the appraisals generate a viability deficit of c. £24.16m'.*  It goes on to say that *'if the deficit were to be absorbed by the Applicant's* \[NHG] *target return, the equivalent profit would equate to 5.22% on GDV (blended)'*.  This 'Gross Development Value' is the combined worth of all the housing and commercial premises and amounts to £258.76m.  So, even though the scheme is *'unviable'*, it is still expected to make a profit of £13.5m (5.22% of £258.76m)[^X].

According to this line of thinking, NHG's assessment the £13.51m profit is described as a *'viability deficit'*; NHG says *'This is lower than typical target thresholds for schemes of this size and also below any of the thresholds adopted/ accepted for other estate regeneration schemes across London'*.

The assessment makes the cautious caveat that should both sales values and costs improve by around 5%, then the scheme would become viable, which means it could generate a much higher profit of 14.55% of GDV and still provide the 50% affordable housing, required by the Southwark Plan 2022. 

The viability assessment also sets the benchmark land value at £0, *'based on the development agreement between NHG and LB Southwark'*, which indicates that nothing has been paid for the land.  If NHG had to pay for the land then this would increase the *'viability deficit'* and reduce profit.

#### The Mayor mends NHG's profit

The updated viability assessment replaces the original assessment for the first version of the scheme.  The original assessment gave a profit level of 12.27%, and an expected profit of £29.94m.  This is higher than the 5.22% and £13.51 in the revised assessment, and so looks like a drop in profit for NHG of £16.43m [^X].

However, this loss is made up to a large extent by an increase in the money that NHG are getting from the Mayor to build affordable housing on Phase 2B.  This is rising from £28.79m to £42.51m, helping to reduce the drop in profit to £2.71m [^X].

though are receiving a GLA affordable housing grant from the Mayor for Phase 2B.  This was originally to be £The viability assessments also show, though, that the Mayor's GLA Affordable Housing Grant has increased from £28.79m to £42.51m - an increase of £13.72m, leaving the net drop at £2.71m.
