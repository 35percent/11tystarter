Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) have updated their [planning application for Phase 2B](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=RDU2YJKB00300) of the Aylesbury regeneration.  The new proposal increases the number of homes from 617 to 640, with an increase in the number of social rented homes from 163 to 173 and of intermediate part-buy/part-let homes from 82 to 89.  The number of private homes has been increased to 378 from 369.

There will also be either one or two additional floors on six of the eleven buildings. All the blocks are between five and ten storeys, with one tower of 26 storeys, which remains the same height [^1].

The updated application retains the same reference number, 22/AP/2226, as the original application, made in June 2022 and approved by Southwark's planning committee in January 2023, but not concluded by a legal agreement.  NHG say that the updated application was necessary because of new fire safety requirements, including the need to add second staircases to four of the blocks.

#### Over 150 social rented homes will be lost

Phase 2B entails the demolition of 241-171 Wendover, Padbury, Winslow and Ravensbourne, with the loss of 373 homes, of which 327 remain council housing, giving a net loss of 154 social rented homes, if NHG's proposals are approved [^2].

#### NHG abandons the OPP

The application also remains a 'standalone' or 'drop-in' application, outside the parameters of the Outline Planning Permission (OPP), which NHG already holds for the Phase 2b, Phase 2c, Phase 3 and Phase 4, which together make up the rest of the regeneration.

NHG says that it is submitting a standalone application because it cannot complete the scheme within the OPP masterplan timescale.  NHG also say that the OPP will not allow the development to meet the Mayor's policy requirement that demolished affordable housing must be replaced by an equivalent amount of affordable housing floorspace [^3].

#### More or less social rented housing?

NHG claim that, unlike the OPP, the 'stand-alone' application will increase the amount of social rent and affordable floorspace, despite the loss of 154 social rent units.  NHG say that this because more of the new homes will be bigger family-sized units.  

However, the amount of family-housing proposed by NHG fails to meet Southwark's policy requirements, on at least three measures;

* A minimum of **70%** 2+ bed homes is required; only **64.5%** is proposed.
* A minimum of **20%** family homes with 3+ beds is required; only **15.94%** is proposed
* A minimum of **3%** 5-bed homes is required; only **1.72%** is proposed. 

One measure is met - a minimum of 7% 4-bed homes is required and 7.66% is proposed.

There is no ready information about the number of 2 bed/3 person and 2 bed/4 person homes, nor if there will be any studio flats (a maximum of 3% are allowed as private housing [^4].

NHG also claim that the number of social rented habitable rooms will increase overall, but do not give a baseline figure for what already exists, against which to measure this claim.  The [January 2023 planning committee report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s111174/Report%20-%20Aylesbury%20Phase%202B.pdf) says that there will be an uplift of 254 habitable rooms, but calculates this on an implausibly low figure of 484 habitable rooms for the existing 327 council homes.  This would only be an average of 1.48 hb rm per dwelling, when the average for social housing across the whole estate is 3.06 hb rm per dwelling [^5]. 

#### No houses

There will also be no houses on Phase 2B, although the number of maisonettes will be greater than that required by policy (20% against 17%) \[REF - DAS Pt 1; PS].

This is a significant departure from the original Aylesbury plans.  The now discarded Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010 (AAAP), emphasised the benefits of houses as a type of family home.  The AAAP defines a house as a *'self contained residential dwelling. Houses can be detached, semi detached or terraced'* [^6] and promised that nearly a quarter of the new homes would be houses, saying *'We will respond, for example, to the needs of families...........23% of new homes will be houses with access to gardens'* [^7].  

The AAAP notes that *'Increasing the proportion of homes suitable for families was a key concern which local residents raised during consultation'* and *'Providing a high proportion of houses will enable more households to have their own front doors which open onto the street and will also help minimise common parts. This will increase street level activity and will reduce many of the problems associated with higher density living. It also reduces the management costs for residents'* [^8].

#### Not financially viable, but still profitable

The updated proposal is larger than the original in response to updated fire regulations which require changes, such as extra staircases in four of the blocks, which reduce the amount of residential floorspace.  Extra floors have been added to compensate, taking the total number of new homes to 640.

NHG say that this is *'to ensure the scheme viably delivers the required affordable homes'* \[REF].  The viability assessment for the scheme concludes the opposite, saying *'our appraisals demonstrated this scheme to be unviable generating a deficit of c. £6.69m.....'.*  

It must be noted though, that *'unviable'* aso does not mean unprofitable, just less profitable.  NHG will not be making a much as they would like, but they will not be making a loss.  The assessment says that if the deficit is absorbed into profits it *'reduces the lower than typical target thresholds for schemes of this size and also below any of the thresholds adopted / accepted for other estate regeneration schemes across London'.*  In other words, while NHG want a *'typical'* profit (15% of Gross Development Value), it will only get 12.7% GDV or, put in cash terms, a profit of £31.04m, instead of £36.7m.

#### £0 for the land

The viability assessment also sets the benchmark land value at £0, *'based on the development agreement between NHG and LB Southwark'*, which indicates that nothing has been paid for the land.  NHG are also in receipt of £23.78m from the Mayor's Affordable Housing Fund, which lays down the  \[LINK] - expand; conditions

#### NHG's poor record

NHG has had the Outline Planning Permission for remainder of the Aylesbury regeneration since 2015, but after nine years has yet to complete a single site. Plot 18 is almost finished, but while it includes a very welcome new library and health facility, it is relatively small in terms of housing, having just 122 new homes. 

NHG also had planning permission for the First Development Site, also now almost finished, but most of this was taken over by Southwark Council in 2018 \[to be completed in 2025? CHECK;LINK].  Both Plot 18 and the FDS come several years after the fully completed sites Site 1a \[DATE] and Site 7 \[DATE], both built by L&Q.

#### Five reasons not to give Phase 2b planning permission

On the face of it a proposal for 640 new homes, with relatively generous proportions of affordabe and social rented housing looks attractive. But the there are at least four reasons why planning permission should not be given; 

* NHG has only delivered 79 social rented homes in the ten years since they got the OPP; less than the number knocked down.
* NHG is looking to make £31.04m profit on Phase 2b, while getting the land for nothing, barely increasing family housing and reducing the number of social rented homes
* NHG is not providing any houses on the 'new' Aylesbury, despite their attested benefits for families and the promises made to residents
* Both the AAAP and OPP have been abandoned, so NHG no longer has any coherent plan for the remainder of the regeneration;
