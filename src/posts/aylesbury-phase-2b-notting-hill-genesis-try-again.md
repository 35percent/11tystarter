Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) have updated their [planning application for Phase 2B](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage) of the Aylesbury regeneration.  The new proposal increases the number of homes from 617 to 640, with an increase in the number of social rented homes from 163 to 173 and of intermediate part-buy/part-let homes from 82 to 89.  The number of private homes has been increased to 378 from 369.

There will also be either one or two additional floors on six of the eleven buildings. All the blocks are between five and ten storeys, with one tower of 26 storeys, which remains the same height [^1].



#### Over 154 social rented homes to be lost

The phase entails the demolition of 241-171 Wendover, Padbury, Winslow and Ravensbourne, with the loss of 373 homes, of which 327 remain council housing, giving a net loss of 154 social rented homes[^2].

The updated application retains the same reference number, 22/AP/2226, as the original application, made in June 2022 and approved by Southwark's planning committee in January 2023.  NHG say that the updated application was necessary because of new fire safety requirements, including the need to add second staircases to four of the blocks.

#### NHG abandons the OPP

The application also remains a 'standalone' or 'drop-in' application, outside the parameters of the Outline Planning Permission (OPP), which NHG already holds for the site and for the regeneration of the rest of the Aylesbury.

Part of the reason for this, according to NHG, is that it cannot complete the whole scheme within the OPP timescale and the OPP will also not allow it to meet the Mayor's policy requirement that demolished affordable housing must be replaced by an equivalent amount of affordable housing floorspace,[^3].

#### More or less social rented housing?

Notwithstanding the net loss of 154 social rent units, NHG nonetheless claim that, unlike the OPP, the 'drop-in' application will increase the amount of social rent and affordable floorspace, because more of the units will be family sized.  This is despite the fact that the amount of family housing fails to meet Southwark's policy requirements, where the housing proposed falls short on at least three measures;

* A minimum of **70%** 2+ bed homes is required; only **64.5%** is proposed.
* A minimum of **20%** family homes with 3+ beds is required; only **15.94%** is proposed
* A minimum of **3%** 5-bed homes; only **1.72%** is proposed. 

One measure is met - a minimum of 7% 4 bed homes is required and 7.66% is proposed.

There is no ready information about the number of two-bedroom homes that will be 2 bed/3 person and 2 bed/4 person homes, nor if there will be any studio flats (a maximum of 3% are allowed as private housing [^4]

NHG also claim that the number of social rented habitable rooms will increase over, but do not give a baseline figure for what already exists, against which to measure this claim.  The January 2023 planning committee report says that there will be an uplift of 254 habitable rooms, but calculates this on an an implausibly low figure of 484 habitable rooms for the existing 327council homes.  This would only be an average of 1.48 hb rm per dwelling, when the average for social housing across the whole estate is 3.06 hb rm per dwelling [^5]. 

#### No houses

There will also be no houses on Phase 2B, although the number of maisonettes will be greater than that required by policy (20% against 17%) \[REF - DAS Pt 1; PS].

This is a significant departure from the now discarded Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010 (AAAP), which emphasised the benfits of houses as a type of family home.  The AAAP defines them as a *'self contained residential dwelling. Houses can be detached, semi detached or terraced'* [^6] and promised that nearly a quarter of the new homes would be houses, saying *'We will respond, for example, to the needs of families...........23% of new homes will be houses with access to gardens'* [^7].  

The AAAP notes that *'Increasing the proportion of homes suitable for families was a key concern which local residents raised during consultation'* and *'Providing a high proportion of houses will enable more households to have their own front doors which open onto the street and will also help minimise common parts. This will increase street level activity and will reduce many of the problems associated with higher density living. It also reduces the management costs for residents'* [^8].

#### What about the future phases?

NHG's record is poor.  NHG has had the OPP for the remainder of the Aylesbury regeneration for over nine years, since 2015, and has yet to complete a single site. Plot 18 is almost finished, but while it includes a very welcome new library and health facility it is relatively small in terms of housing, having just 122 new homes. 

NHG also had planning permission for the First Development Site, also now almost finished, but most of this was taken over by Southwark Council in 2018 \[to be completed in 2025? CHECK;LINK].  Both Plot 18 and the FDS come several years after the fully completed sites Site 1a \[DATE] and Site 7 \[DATE], both built by L&Q.

NHG have abandoned the OPP for Phase 2B for reasons that will apply to all the remaining phases 2C, 3, and 4 - ie that they cannot be build within the OPP's masterplan's timescale and they cannot reprovide the lost affordable housing floorspace.

NHG and Southwark Council have also abandoned the attempt to protect the validity of the OPP for future phases.  NHG's proposal to change the OPP's wording, with this aim (and with Southwark's support) was quashed in the High Court, leaving the OPP legally vulnerable 

Quote from Southwark Law Centre '*I have deep concerns about the legal consequences of this development going ahead, in light of the Hillside case (as confirmed by Dennis). My understanding is that, if this application were granted and development began pursuant to it, it would render any further development under the OPP (on other Phases) unlawful. In other words, it would stop all future development across the Aylesbury, and would require a whole new masterplan permission to be sought. I am concerned that the Council have not fully recognised this, or there is an ulterior consideration that is being kept secretâ€¦*

It looks as if we can only look forward to piecemeal development, without the integrity promised by the AAAP, fo as long as NHG are in control of the regeneration.  It is clear that NHG will not be delivering the regeneration as promised to residents and the local community, as described in the AAAP, and as 

If NHG cannot deliver the regeneration promised under the AAAP it should be taken from them
