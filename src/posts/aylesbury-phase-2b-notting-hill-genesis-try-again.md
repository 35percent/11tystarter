Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) have updated their [planning application for Phase 2B](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage) of the Aylesbury regeneration.  The new proposal increases the number of homes from 617 to 640, with an increase in the number of social rented homes from 163 to 173 and of intermediate part-buy/part-let homes from 82 to 89.  The number of private homes has been increased to 378 from 369.

There will also be either one or two additional floors on six of the eleven buildings. All the blocks are between five and ten storeys, with one tower of 26 storeys, which remains the same height [^1].

#### Over 150 social rented homes will be lost

The phase entails the demolition of 241-171 Wendover, Padbury, Winslow and Ravensbourne, with the loss of 373 homes, of which 327 remain council housing, giving a net loss of 154 social rented homes[^2].

The updated application retains the same reference number, 22/AP/2226, as the original application, made in June 2022 and approved by Southwark's planning committee in January 2023.  NHG say that the updated application was necessary because of new fire safety requirements, including the need to add second staircases to four of the blocks.

#### NHG abandons the OPP

The application also remains a 'standalone' or 'drop-in' application, outside the parameters of the Outline Planning Permission (OPP), which NHG already holds for the Phase 2b, Phase 2c, Phase 3 and Phase 4, which together make up the rest of the regeneration.

NHG says that it is submitting a standalone application because it cannot complete the scheme within the OPP masterplan timescale.  NHG also say that the OPP will not allow the development to meet the Mayor's policy requirement that demolished affordable housing must be replaced by an equivalent amount of affordable housing floorspace,[^3].

#### More or less social rented housing?

NHG claim that, unlike the OPP, the 'drop-in' application will increase the amount of social rent and affordable floorspace, despite the loss of 154 social rent units.  NHG say that this because more of the new homes will be bigger family-sized units.  

However, the amount of family-housing proposed by NHG fails to meet Southwark's policy requirements, on at least three measures;

* A minimum of **70%** 2+ bed homes is required; only **64.5%** is proposed.
* A minimum of **20%** family homes with 3+ beds is required; only **15.94%** is proposed
* A minimum of **3%** 5-bed homes is required; only **1.72%** is proposed. 

One measure is met - a minimum of 7% 4 bed homes is required and 7.66% is proposed.

There is no ready information about the number of two-bedroom homes that will be 2 bed/3 person and 2 bed/4 person homes, nor if there will be any studio flats (a maximum of 3% are allowed as private housing [^4].

NHG also claim that the number of social rented habitable rooms will increase, but do not give a baseline figure for what already exists, against which to measure this claim.  The [January 2023 planning committee report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s111174/Report%20-%20Aylesbury%20Phase%202B.pdf) says that there will be an uplift of 254 habitable rooms, but calculates this on an implausibly low figure of 484 habitable rooms for the existing 327 council homes.  This would only be an average of 1.48 hb rm per dwelling, when the average for social housing across the whole estate is 3.06 hb rm per dwelling [^5]. 

#### No houses

There will also be no houses on Phase 2B, although the number of maisonettes will be greater than that required by policy (20% against 17%) \[REF - DAS Pt 1; PS].

This is a significant departure from the now discarded Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010 (AAAP), which emphasised the benefits of houses as a type of family home.  The AAAP defines a house as a *'self contained residential dwelling. Houses can be detached, semi detached or terraced'* [^6] and promised that nearly a quarter of the new homes would be houses, saying *'We will respond, for example, to the needs of families...........23% of new homes will be houses with access to gardens'* [^7].  

The AAAP notes that *'Increasing the proportion of homes suitable for families was a key concern which local residents raised during consultation'* and *'Providing a high proportion of houses will enable more households to have their own front doors which open onto the street and will also help minimise common parts. This will increase street level activity and will reduce many of the problems associated with higher density living. It also reduces the management costs for residents'* [^8].

#### Not financially viable, but still profitable

The updated proposal is larger than the original in response to updated fire regulations which require changes, such as extra staircases in four of the blocks, which reduce the amount of residential floorspace.  Extra floors have been added to compensate, taking the total number of new homes to 640.

NHG say that this is *'to ensure the scheme viably delivers the required affordable homes'* \[REF].  The viability assessment for the scheme concludes something to the contrary*,* saying *'our appraisals demonstrated this scheme to be unviable generating a deficit of c. £6.69m.....'.*  

This seeming contradiction is solved, though, when it's noted that *'unviable'* aso does not mean unprofitable, just less profitable.  The assessment says that if the deficit is absorbed into profits it *'reduces the lower than typical target thresholds for schemes of this size and also below any of the thresholds adopted / accepted for other estate regeneration schemes across London'.*  Put another way, while NHG want a *'typical'* profit (15% of Gross Development Value), it will only get 12.7% GDV; in cash terms a profit of £31.04m, instead of £36.7m.  NHG will not be making a much as they would like, but they will not be making a loss.

#### £0 for the land

The viability assessment also notes that the benchmark landvalue is set at £0, *'based on the development agreement between NHG and LB Southwark'* which indicates that nothing has been paid for the land.  NHG are also in receipt of £23.78m from the Mayor's Affordable Housing Fund \[LINK] - expand; conditions

#### What about the future phases?

NHG's record is poor.  NHG has had the OPP for the remainder of the Aylesbury regeneration for over nine years, since 2015, and has yet to complete a single site. Plot 18 is almost finished, but while it includes a very welcome new library and health facility it is relatively small in terms of housing, having just 122 new homes. 

NHG also had planning permission for the First Development Site, also now almost finished, but most of this was taken over by Southwark Council in 2018 \[to be completed in 2025? CHECK;LINK].  Both Plot 18 and the FDS come several years after the fully completed sites Site 1a \[DATE] and Site 7 \[DATE], both built by L&Q.

NHG have abandoned the OPP for Phase 2B for reasons that will apply to all the remaining phases 2C, 3, and 4 - ie that they cannot be build within the OPP's masterplan's timescale and they cannot reprovide the lost affordable housing floorspace.

NHG and Southwark Council have also abandoned the attempt to protect the validity of the OPP for future phases.  NHG's proposal to change the OPP's wording, with this aim (and with Southwark's support) was quashed in the High Court, leaving the OPP legally vulnerable 

Quote from Southwark Law Centre '*I have deep concerns about the legal consequences of this development going ahead, in light of the Hillside case (as confirmed by Dennis). My understanding is that, if this application were granted and development began pursuant to it, it would render any further development under the OPP (on other Phases) unlawful. In other words, it would stop all future development across the Aylesbury, and would require a whole new masterplan permission to be sought. I am concerned that the Council have not fully recognised this, or there is an ulterior consideration that is being kept secret…*

It looks as if we can only look forward to piecemeal development, without the integrity promised by the AAAP, fo as long as NHG are in control of the regeneration.  It is clear that NHG will not be delivering the regeneration as promised to residents and the local community, as described in the AAAP, and as 

If NHG cannot deliver the regeneration promised under the AAAP it should be taken from them

#### NHG's record - number of social rented units delivered by NHG

The updated application has a long explanation of what has been built by so far, largely by others; reveals how little social rented housing NHG has provided

FDS C - 56, Plot 18 - 23; total 79 - table of social rent delivered to date  L&Q 148 ; Southwark - 581; NHG - 79

FDS C - 56, Plot 18 - 23; Phase 2B - 173; total 252

Leaving aside whether or not there will be more social rent floorspace - when the number of demolished homes is taken into account, after ten years and assuming that Phase 2B will get built (more 172 not yet built) we will have still have 75 fewer social rented homes from NHG than we have already (327 minus 252 = 75)

They only refer to the High Court case that quashed an attempt to amend the OPP in passing
