Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) have updated their [planning application for Phase 2B](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage) of the Aylesbury regeneration.  The new proposal increases the number of homes from 617 to 640, with an increase in the number of social rented homes from 163 to 173 and of intermediate part-buy/part-let homes from 82 to 89.  The number of private homes has been increased to 378 from 369.

There will also be either one or two additional floors on six of the eleven buildings. All the blocks are between five and ten storeys, with one tower of 26 storeys, which remains the same height [^1].

#### Over 154 social rented homes to be lost

The phase entails the demolition of 241-171 Wendover, Padbury, Winslow and Ravensbourne, with the loss of 373 homes, of which 327 remain council housing, giving a net loss of 154 social rented homes[^2].

The updated application retains the same reference number, 22/AP/2226, as the original application, made in June 2022 and approved by Southwark's planning committee in January 2023.  NHG say that the updated application was necessary because of new fire safety requirements, including the need to add second staircases to four of the blocks.

#### NHG abandons the OPP

The application also remains a 'standalone' or 'drop-in' application, outside the parameters of the Outline Planning Permission (OPP), which NHG already holds for the site and for the regeneration of the rest of the Aylesbury.

Part of the reason for this, according to NHG, is that it cannot complete the whole scheme within to the OPP timescale and because it cannot meet the Mayor's policy requirement that demolished affordable housing must be replaced by an equivalent amount of affordable housing floorspace, within the OPP[^3].

#### More or less social rented housing?

Notwithstanding the net loss of 154 social rent units, NHG nonetheless claim that, unlike the OPP, the 'drop-in' application will increase the amount of social rent and affordable floorspace, because more of the units will be family sized.  This is despite the fact that the amount of family housing fails to meet Southwark's policy requirements, where the housing proposed falls short on at least three measures;

* A minimum of **70%** 2+ bed homes is required; only **64.5%** is proposed.
* A minimum of **20%** family homes with 3+ beds is required; only **15.94%** is proposed
* A minimum of **3%** 5-bed homes; only **1.72%** is proposed. 

One measure is met - a minimum of 7% 4 bed homes is required and 7.66% is proposed.

There is no ready information about the number of two-bedroom homes that will be 2 bed/3 person and 2 bed/4 person homes, nor if there will be any studio flats (a maximum of 3% are allowed as private housing [^4]

NHG also claim that the number of social rented habitable rooms will increase over, but do not give a baseline figure for what already exists, against which to measure this claim.  The January 2023 planning committee report says that there will be an uplift of 254 habitable rooms, but calculates this on an an implausibly low figure of 484 habitable rooms for the existing 327council homes.  This would only be an average of 1.48 hb rm per dwelling, when the average for social housing across the whole estate is 3.06 hb rm per dwelling [^5].

A habitable room is one that is used for living, sleeping, eating or cooking (not a bathroom).  The figures used to calculate the average number of habitable rooms for social housing on the whole estate come from the Officer's report 14/AP/3844, 23 April 2015, para 89.
