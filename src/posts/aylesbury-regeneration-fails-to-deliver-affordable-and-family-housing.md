One of the completed Aylesbury regeneration sites has failed to deliver all the affordable and family housing that is required by its planning permission (link).  Plot 18 is just the third plot of the estate's regeneration to be completed since 1997 (NB after Site 1A, Site 7), with a fourth site, the First Development Site, also nearing completion.

Plot 18 will supply 122 residential units, a medical centre and .....(ADD).  The plot's development entailed the demolition of x number of council homes in a-b Missenden.

However, a report lodged with Southwark Council's planning department in Septmeber 2023(link) by developer Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) reveals that less than half of the required affordable housing promised for Plot 18 has been built.  The report is NHG's Housing Delivery Strategy (link) and it says that while 50% of the housing should be affordable, only 22.9% (XX units) has been provided.  The Strategy renames Plot 18 as 'Development Stage 2A' and says that it *'will provide 358 Habitable Rooms, of which 82 Habitable Rooms (22.9%) will be Affordable Housing'*
