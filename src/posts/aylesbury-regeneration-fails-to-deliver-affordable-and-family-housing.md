A nearly-completed Aylesbury regeneration site has failed to deliver all the affordable and family housing that is required by its [planning permission](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=R95ATPKB00300&activeTab=summary).  Plot 18 will be just the third plot of the estate's regeneration to be completed since 1997 (after Site 1A and Site 7, delivered by L&Q housing association), with a fourth site, the First Development Site, also in its final stages.

Plot 18 will provides [122 residential units, a medical centre, a library and a early years facility](http://www.aylesburynow.london/regeneration/planning-information/plot-18).  The plot's development entailed the demolition of 34 council and leasehold homes in 57-76 Northchurch and 300-313 Missenden.

Despite the undoubted benefits of the new medical centre, library and early years facility, a  report lodged with Southwark Council's planning department, by developer Notting Hill Genesis (NHG), reveals that less than half of the required affordable housing promised for Plot 18 has been built.  The report is NHG's [Housing Delivery Strategy, September 2023](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf).  The Strategy says that while 50% of the housing should be affordable, only 22.9% (measured by habitable room) has been provided.  The Strategy refers to Plot 18 as Development Stage 2A and says that it *'will provide 358 Habitable Rooms, of which 82 Habitable Rooms (22.9%) will be Affordable Housing'* and *'this does not meet the requirement to provide a minimum of  50% of Habitable Rooms as Affordable Housing'*.

### Plot 18's lost social rented and shared ownership homes

The percentages are measured in habitable rooms (living room, bedroom, kitchen), giving a loss of 97 habitable rooms, which works out as a loss of about 32 affordable homes, if they were all one-bed flats.  The planning permission requires that 75% of these should be social rent, which would be 24 units, leaving eight as shared-ownership homes.

[NHG's Strategy](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf) justifies these affordable housing shortfalls on the grounds that the First Development Site (FDS) has an *'overprovision'* of affordable housing and that taken together the two sites will have be 60.9% affordable housing.  The Strategy neglects to add that the great majority of the affordable housing on the FDS is being provided by Southwark Council, not NHG.  Southwark Council [took over FDS 'A' and FDS 'B' in 2022](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-07-09-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/), with great fanfare, and is providing 581 council homes at a cost of over £200m.  Under the deal NHG retained FDS 'C', which will have xxx free-market units and just 56 social rented homes (CHECK).

### Family housing promises forgotten

NHG also comes up short for houses on Plot 18.  About a fifth of the new homes should be houses, which would be around 14 three-bed homes, whereas the number actually provided is....**zero.**

Houses are distinguished from other types of dwelling, such as flats, and are particularly valued as family homes.  The now discarded [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1647/Aylesbury-AAP-2010.pdf) defines them as a *'self contained residential dwelling. Houses
can be detached, semi detached or terraced'* [^1].  The AAAP promised that nearly a quarter of the new homes would be houses, saying *'We will respond, for example, to the needs of families...........23% of new homes will be houses with access to gardens'* [^2]. 

The AAAP 2010 notes that  *'Increasing the proportion of homes suitable for families was a key concern which local residents raised during consultation'* and '*Providing a high proportion of houses will enable more households to have their own front doors which open onto the street and will also help minimise common parts. This will increase street level activity and will reduce many of the problems associated with higher density living. It also reduces the management costs for residents'* [^3].

![](img/fig_5_housing_delivery_strategy_23ap2603.png "Housing Delivery Stategy showing showing zero houses on Plot 18")

Despite these well-attested benefits the number of houses required in the regeneration is now 19.7% of total dwellings (by habitable rooms), according to the [NHG Strategy](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf), not the 23% given in the AAAP 2010.  19.7% amounts to 70.5 habitable rooms on Plot 18, which is about 14 three-bed houses, but the [NHG Strategy](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf) candidly states *'As shown in Figure 5 Development Stage 2A does not provide any ‘Houses’*.

NHG justify supplying no houses on Plot 18 by referring to the s106 agreement between themselves and Southwark, which allows them to spread the 19.7% of houses across the whole development.  They go on to say that the shortfall *'could be achieved through the increased provision of 'Houses' within future phases'*, without actually stating that this is what they will do.

### Maisonettes, Duplexes and bigger family homes all go missing...

The pattern of shortfalls is repeated for maisonettes/duplexes and larger 2-bed homes.  The AAAP 2010 notes their role as family housing  *'At a borough wide level there is a need for a mix of dwellings, particularly those capable of accommodating families. The proportion of maisonettes and houses will help meet this need'* [^4].

[NHG's Strategy](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf) reports that while 17% of dwellings should be maisonettes/duplexes, there are none on Plot 18.  The Strategy then goes on to propose 'the  *'the necessary amendments within future Development Stages (namely Development Stage 2B/C) to ensure that the Minimum Maisonettes / Duplexes Requirement is met'* but without actually promising that this is going to happen.

Similarly, half of Plot 18's two-bed homes should be for four persons, giving 26 new two-bed/four-person homes, but instead there only 4 two-bed/four-person homes - a shortfall of twenty-two.  Again, NHG proposes making up the difference on the next Stage 2B/C, which would need to provide 205.4 two-bed/four-person homes.  

### Will the shortfalls be made up?

It is clear that NHG has purposely underprovided both affordable and social rented housing and larger family-type housing on Plot 18.  NHG claims that it can do this under the terms of the s106 agreement with Southwark, covering the remainder of the Aylesbury regeneration and that the shortfall in the number of maisonettes/duplexes and two-bed/four person homes *'could'* be made up in future phases.

In the case of affordable housing NHG also claims that because more than 50% affordable housing has been provided on the FDS (by Southwark, as council housing) then NHG can deliver less affordable housing on Stage 2B/C.  It is obvious that if it does this, then Southwark Council will have effectively subsidised NHG's affordable housing contribution, through its £200m purchase of FDS 'A' and 'B' [^5].  It is equally obvious that local people will lose affordable and social rented housing.

NHG has already [started to consult](http://www.aylesburynow.london/web/uploads/files/news_254_0.pdf?nocache=4626) on the Aylesbury's next phase, Phase 2B.  It has proposed 50% affordable housing, not the reduced amount of 41.1% proposed in the Strategy for Stage 2B/2C, but it is not clear that this will be enough to make up what has been lost on Plot 18.  NHG also proposes maisonettes in mansion blocks, but whether these will be in enough numbers to also make up for what is lost on Plot 18 is again unclear.  Finally, NHG have proposed 179 two-bed/four-person homes for Phase 2B, which is 26.4 units short of the 205.4 needed over Stage 2B/C to make up for those lost on Plot 18 [^5].  There is no sign of any houses in the Phase 2B proposal.  There is also only the vaguest acknowledgement of future phases, which are to be completed by *'2030 and beyond'.*

NHG will also making their planning application for Phase 2B as a 'standalone' application, outside of the outline planning permission for the regeneration of the whole estate, which they have held since 2015.  This means that the [NHG Strategy](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf)  justifying Plot 18's shortfalls on Plot 18, and the possibility of making these up, may not apply to Phase 2B, because the Strategy relates only to the outline permission[^7].  

### NHG eats Southwark's lunch - twice

NHG has not only failed to build the 50% affordable housing it should have on Plot 18, it also wants to reduce the amount on the next phases, Stage 2B/C.  Southwark has provided 65.7% affordable housing on the First Devlopment Site (FDS), in the shape of 581 council homes; NHG want to take advantage of this 'overprovision' to reduce their contribution in Stage 2B/C to only 41.1%.  NHG justify this demand by arguing that because Southwark provided more than 50% on the FDS, which Southwark took over in 2016 (CHECK DATE), NHG should be allowed to provide less.

### What we say

Although Strategy has been with Southwark Council for over a year, Southwark have not yet approved it.  This approval is needed by NHG before they can get any of the necessary further planning permissions to complete the Aylesbury's regeneration.

Will it approve the NHG's housing strategy and defer delivery of the affordable and family housing to future phases?

NHG proposes taking advantage of clauses in the legal s106 agreement to deliver the missing affordable and family housing at later stages of the development.  But NHG's record is poor.  It has held an outline planning permission for ten years, since 2014 and has only built....Southwark Council took over most of the FDS iteself in 201? at the cost of £200m (link) and now NHG is trying to use the council homes that Southwark has paid for to reduce its own affordable housing obligation.  Instead of pushing on with detailed permissions under the OPP it has tried to squeeze more out of Phase 2b than that allowed and having failed first time is back with a second attempt. Finally it has underdelivered on both affordable and family housing on Plot 18 and wants Southwark to sign up to the vaguest undertaking that these 'could' be made up in future phases. With such a miserable record, no-one can have any confidence in NHG completing the Aylesbury regeneration and delivering the promised and much-needed affordable and social rented housing.

It's time for Southwark to lay the law down...

  and failed to For that money it provided 581 much-needed council homes.  NHG has decided it will undermine the undoubted benefit of these homes to local people, by reducing the amount of affordable housing it will deliver on the remainder of the regeneration.  This cannot be right, whether or not it is allowable under the s106 agreement,.

NHG need Southwark's written agreement to its demands, before it can proceed with the regeneration under its outline planning permission.  NHG has already tried once to  build outside of this permission, on Phase 2B, but fell foul of the High Court (link).  It is now making a second attempt with another similar identical 'standalone' application for Phase 2B, again outside of the outline planning permission parameters.

Southwark must make this clear to NHG - 'you have had an outline planning planning permission since 2014, we expect you to fulfill it, with 50% affordable housing on every phase and with all the family housing that was promised.

Questions for Southwark; did it know during construction that the affordable/family housing was not going to be provided?  Why was this information not included in the July Cabinet update? Is it in the confidential report of that date? (35% Campaign has FOI-ed this).
