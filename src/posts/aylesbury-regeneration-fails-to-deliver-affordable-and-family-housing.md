IMAGE OF AYLESBURY or SCREENSHOT OF STRATEGY COVER

One of the completed Aylesbury regeneration sites has failed to deliver all the affordable and family housing that is required by its planning permission (link).  Plot 18 is just the third plot of the estate's regeneration to be completed since 1997 (NB after Site 1A, Site 7), with a fourth site, the First Development Site, also nearing completion.

Plot 18 will supply 122 residential units, a medical centre and .....(ADD).  The plot's development entailed the demolition of x number of council homes in a-b Missenden.

SCREENSHOT OF STRATEGY COVER?

However, a report lodged with Southwark Council's planning department in Septmeber 2023(link) by developer Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) reveals that less than half of the required affordable housing promised for Plot 18 has been built.  The report is NHG's Housing Delivery Strategy (LINK) and it says that while 50% of the housing should be affordable, only 22.9% (XX units) has been provided.  The Strategy renames Plot 18 as 'Development Stage 2A' and says that it *'will provide 358 Habitable Rooms, of which 82 Habitable Rooms (22.9%) will be Affordable Housing'* and *'this does not meet the requirement to provide a minimum of  50% of Habitable Rooms as Affordable Housing'* (LINK, SCREENSHOT OF ).  

The Strategy justifies this failure on the grounds that the First Development Site (FDS) has an *'overprovision'* of affordable housing and that taken together the two sites will have be 60.9% affordable housing.  The Strategy neglects to add that the great majority of the affordable housing on the FDS is being provided by Southwark Council, not NHG.  Southwark Council took over FDS 'A' and FDS 'B' in 2022, with great fanfare, and is providing 561/581 council homes at a cost of over Â£200m (LINK, CHECK).  Under the deal NHG retained FDS 'C', which will have xxx free-market units and just 56 social rented homes (CHECK).

### Family housing is lost too...

The same Housing Strategy report also reveals that Plot 18 does not have enough 'Houses' and Duplexes/Maisonettes and Two Bedroom Fourperson homes.  These are all larger dwelling types, used for family housing (DEFINITION OF HOUSE? 3+ BEDROOMS - more detail).  MORE DETAIL

What does any previous Strategy say? Check s106 and DOVs.

### NHG's solution

NHG proposes taking advantage of clauses in the legal s106 agreement to deliver the missing affordable and family housing at later stages of the development.

Although Strategy has been with Southwark Council for over a year, Southwark have not yet approved it.  This approval is needed by NHG before they can get any of the necessary further planning permissions to complete the Aylesbury's regeneration.

Questions for Southwark; did it know during construction that the affordable/family housing was not going to be provided?  Why was this information not included in the July Cabinet update? Is it in the confidential report of that date? (35% Campaign has FOI-ed this). Will it approve the NHG's housing strategy and deferr delivery of the affordable and family housing to future phases?
