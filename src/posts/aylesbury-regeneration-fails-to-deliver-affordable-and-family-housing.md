A completed Aylesbury regeneration site has failed to deliver all the affordable and family housing that is required by its [planning permission](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=R95ATPKB00300&activeTab=summary).  Plot 18 is just the third plot of the estate's regeneration to be completed since 1997 (after Site 1A and Site 7, delivered by L&Q housing association), with a fourth site, the First Development Site, also nearing completion.

Plot 18 provides [122 residential units, a medical centre, a library and a early years facility](http://www.aylesburynow.london/regeneration/planning-information/plot-18).  The plot's development entailed the demolition of x number of council homes in 57-76 Northchurch and 300-313 Missenden.

Despite the undoubted benefits the new medical centre, library and early years facility will bring, a  report lodged with Southwark Council's planning department by developer Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) reveals that less than half of the required affordable housing promised for Plot 18 has been built.  The report is NHG's [Housing Delivery Strategy, September 2023](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C27DCC26E24963CB2F1DF09827FD7A8/pdf/23_AP_2603-HOUSING_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.-3727685.pdf).  The Strategy says that while 50% of the housing should be affordable, only 22.9% (measured by habitable room) has been provided.  The Strategy refers to Plot 18 as Development Stage 2A and says that it *'will provide 358 Habitable Rooms, of which 82 Habitable Rooms (22.9%) will be Affordable Housing'* and *'this does not meet the requirement to provide a minimum of  50% of Habitable Rooms as Affordable Housing'* (LINK, SCREENSHOT OF ).

The Strategy justifies this failure on the grounds that the First Development Site (FDS) has an *'overprovision'* of affordable housing and that taken together the two sites will have be 60.9% affordable housing.  The Strategy neglects to add that the great majority of the affordable housing on the FDS is being provided by Southwark Council, not NHG.  Southwark Council took over FDS 'A' and FDS 'B' in 2022, with great fanfare, and is providing 561/581 council homes at a cost of over £200m (LINK, CHECK).  Under the deal NHG retained FDS 'C', which will have xxx free-market units and just 56 social rented homes (CHECK).

### Family housing promises forgotten

Houses are distinguished from other types of dwelling, such as flats, and are particularly valued as family housing.  The now discarded [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1647/Aylesbury-AAP-2010.pdf) defines them as *'self contained residential dwelling. Houses
can be detached, semi detached or terraced'* [^1].  The AAAP promised that nearly a quarter of the new homes would be houses, saying *'We will respond, for example, to the needs of families...........23% of new homes will be houses with access to gardens'* [^2] and *'At a borough wide level there is a need for a mix of dwellings, particularly those capable of accommodating families. The proportion of maisonettes and houses will help meet this need'* [^3].

The AAAP 2010 notes that  *'Increasing the proportion of homes suitable for families was a key concern which local residents raised during consultation'* and '*Providing a high proportion of houses will enable more households to have their own front doors which open onto the street and will also help minimise common parts. This will increase street level activity and will reduce many of the problems associated with higher density living. It also reduces the management costs for residents'* [^4].

Despite their well-attested virtues the number of houses required in the regeneration is now 19.7% of the total number of habitable rooms, according to the Strategy, not the 23% given in the AAAP.  This would amount to about 14 three-bed houses, but the Strategy candidly states *'As shown in Figure 5 Development Stage 2A does not provide any ‘Houses’*.

The same Housing Strategy report also reveals that Plot 18 does not have enough 'Houses' and Duplexes/Maisonettes and Two Bedroom Fourperson homes.  These are all larger dwelling types, used for family housing (DEFINITION OF HOUSE? 3+ BEDROOMS - more detail).  MORE DETAIL

What does any previous Strategy say? Check s106 and DOVs.

### NHG's solution - reduce affordable housing

NHG proposes taking advantage of clauses in the legal s106 agreement to deliver the missing affordable and family housing at later stages of the development.

Although Strategy has been with Southwark Council for over a year, Southwark have not yet approved it.  This approval is needed by NHG before they can get any of the necessary further planning permissions to complete the Aylesbury's regeneration.

Questions for Southwark; did it know during construction that the affordable/family housing was not going to be provided?  Why was this information not included in the July Cabinet update? Is it in the confidential report of that date? (35% Campaign has FOI-ed this). Will it approve the NHG's housing strategy and deferr delivery of the affordable and family housing to future phases?

### NHG eats Southwark's lunch - twice

NHG has not only failed to build the 50% affordable housing it should have on Plot 18, it also wants to reduce the amount on the next phases, Stage 2B/C.  Southwark has provided 65.7% affordable housing on the First Devlopment Site (FDS), in the shape of 581 council homes; NHG want to take advantage of this 'overprovision' to reduce their contribution in Stage 2B/C to only 41.1%.  NHG justify this demand by arguing that because Southwark provided more than 50% on the FDS, which Southwark took over in 2016 (CHECK DATE), NHG should be allowed to provide less.

### What we say

Southwark Council took over the FDS in 201? at the cost of £200m (link).  For that money it provided 581 much-needed council homes.  NHG has decided it will undermine the undoubted benefit of these homes to local people, by reducing the amount of affordable housing it will deliver on the remainder of the regeneration.  This cannot be right, whether or not it is allowable under the s106 agreement,.

NHG need Southwark's written agreement to its demands, before it can proceed with the regeneration under its outline planning permission.  NHG has already tried once to  build outside of this permission, on Phase 2B, but fell foul of the High Court (link).  It is now making a second attempt with an almost identical 'standalone' application for Phase 2B, again outside of the outline planning permission parameters.

Southwark must make it clear to NHG - you have had an outline planning planning permission since 2014, we expect you to fulfill it, with 50% affordable housing on every phase and with all the family housing that was promised too.
