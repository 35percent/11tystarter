Southwark Council's planning committee has formally rejected Berkeley Home's proposals for the redevelopment of Peckham's Aylesham Centre and agreed to defend this decision at a forthcoming public inquiry.  

The Committee met after [Berkeley announced in May that it would go over the Council's head](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2025/statement-berkeley-homes-appeal-its-planning-application-aylesham-centre) and seek a decision on their planning application, by way of an appeal to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government.  The Council will now defend its refusal of the application at a public inquiry, scheduled to begin on 27 Oct.

Local campaign group [Aylesham Community Action](https://www.ayleshamcommunityaction.co.uk/ourcampaign) has vowed to continue its long-running fight againt Berkeley's plans and join the inquiry.  Southwark Housing and Planning Emergency [(SHAPE)](https://x.com/ShapeCoalition1) has also pledged its continuing support in opposing Berkeley's plans. 

The decisions were taken after a marathon meeting on Tues evening (15 July), lasting nearly six hours.  The Committee unanimiously endorsed the reason for refusing the application, presented to them by their planning officers, adding two of their own, plus a further requirement that one issue be returned to them for a final decision.  

SHAPE and ACA pledge to join the fight.

Southwark Council say no to Berkeley Homes

The Berkeley story - £84m profit, but only 50 social rented homes 

BH gave two reasons for only offering 12% affordable housing; first, that an obligation to provide Morrison's with a replacement shopping centre made the Aylesham a risky long-term development.  Secondly, that there had been a more general rise on development costs, along with a slow-down in revenue return (sales).  The Chair of the Committee Cllr Richard Livingstone pointed out that despite the purported lack of viability this caused, the scheme would still generate a profit of £84m.  BH did not deny the fact, but responded by referring to their duty to their shareholders and added that they could not honestly promise to deliver 35% affordable houisng when it was not viable.

Local community speak out

Reperesentatives of the local community supported the recommendation to the commitee to refuse the application and then defend the decision at the October Inquiry.  Led by an ACA representive, Siobhan ??,  they also laid out further objections to Berkeley's proposals - LIST.  James, a trader in the Aylesham of over 5 years, said that he and and fellow traders had no idea of what was proposed, other than that the Aylesham was to be demolished.  He supported development, but it had to be for the benefit of the community.  The Rev. Dean Pusey, of St May Magdelene spoke powerfully, asking the committee to see beyond the economics of the case and look at how the development would effect the ordinary people of Peckham. The Southwark Law Centre solicitor, Jed Holloway urged the committee to broaden the grounds of their defence of the refusal, to include amongst other things, a more forthright commitment to getting the right amount of affordable housing and adverse socio-economic impacts (two of which were adopted).

What we think

The scene is set for a significant showdown.  Not just a local decision - ctritical test of government's commitment to solving the houisng crisis - question whether developers are going to be allowed to get away with ducking their affordable housing responsibilities by waaving viability assessments in the air.  Given that the reasons BH are citing for not being able to provide affordable houisng - rising build costs, slow demand etc - are general, we can expect other developers to follow in their wake (if they are successful)
