Southwark Council's planning committee has formally rejected Berkeley Home's proposals for the redevelopment of Peckham's Aylesham Centre.  They have further agreed to defend this decision at a forthcoming public inquiry.  

The Committee met after [Berkeley announced in May that it would go over the Council's head](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2025/statement-berkeley-homes-appeal-its-planning-application-aylesham-centre) and seek a decision on their planning application, by way of an appeal to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government.  The Council will now defend its refusal of the application at a public inquiry, scheduled to begin on 27 Oct.

Local campaign group [Aylesham Community Action](https://www.ayleshamcommunityaction.co.uk/ourcampaign) has also vowed to continue its long-running fight againt Berkeley's plans, by applying to take part in the inquiry, as an independant 'Rule 6' party.  Southwark Housing and Planning Emergency [(SHAPE)](https://x.com/ShapeCoalition1) has pledged its continuing support.  Both joined together in a lively ['Peck off Berkeley Party demo'](https://x.com/ShapeCoalition1/status/1944436788480585784) oustside the Council's Tooley St offices, before the planning meeting.

The decisions were taken after a marathon meeting on Tues evening (15 July), lasting nearly six hours.  The Committee unanimiously endorsed the single reason for refusing the application, presented to them by their planning officers.  After listening to objectors, Berkeley Homes and ward councillors the Committee added two further reasons, plus a requirement that one issue be returned to them for a final decision.  

#### What Berkeley want to build

The Committee heard how in May 2024 Berkeley initially proposed 877 residential units, with 35% affordable housing, made up of 185 social rented and 85 intermediate homes. In December 2024 Berkeley's amended the application, reducing the total to  867 units, with just 12% affordable housing, made up of 50 social rented and 27 intermediate homes.  It remained a mixed-use development of 16 buildings, up to a height of 20 storeys, to be built in two phases, with completion of Phase 1 due by 2030.

Planning officers told Berkeley in May 2024 that the reduction in affordable housing meant that the public benefits of the proposed development would be outweighed by the harm which it would cause to the local heritage areas.  Berkeley almost immediately made an appeal to the Secretary of State (Angela Raynor) for her to take the decision on the scheme out of the Council's hands.  Berkeley  said that Southwark had not made its own decision within the required timescale.  Southwark responded with [a statement expressing disappointment](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2025/statement-berkeley-homes-appeal-its-planning-application-aylesham-centre) at Berkeley's move, pointing out the need to reconsult the public on their dramatic reduction of affordable housing.[](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2025/statement-berkeley-homes-appeal-its-planning-application-aylesham-centre)

#### Southwark Council say no to Berkeley Homes - the reasons for refusal

A decision on the application will now be taken by a governement appointed inspector at the Oct public inquiry. Southwark's will present the Inquiry with three grounds for refusal -  that any benefit from the low level of affordable housing, including a lack of a Community Land Trust, will not outweigh the harm that the scale of parts of the development will cause to Peckham's character; that their was not enough affordable and social rented housing and that the lost Aylesham retail floorspace was not being fully replaced, both contrary to the Southwark Plan 2022.  The Committee also asked that any relocation strategy for displaced traders return to them for a final decision (citing B Triangle as a precedent, another BH development - LINK)

#### The Berkeley story - £84m profit, but only 50 social rented homes

In response to the planning officers' presentation, Berkeley gave two reasons for only offering 12% affordable housing.  The first was that there was an obligation to provide Morrison's with a replacement shopping centre and that this made the Aylesham a risky, long-term development.  Secondly, Berkeley argued that there had been a more general rise on development costs, along with a slow-down in revenue return (sales).  Taken together these factors meant that the scheme was not viable and could not deliver 35% affordable housing.  

The Chair of the Committee, Cllr Richard Livingstone, pointed out that despite the purported lack of viability of the scheme, it could still generate a profit of £84.4m, even with a viability deficit of £41.4m.  Berkeley did not deny the fact, but responded by referring to their shareholder duty and added that they could not honestly promise to deliver 35% affordable houisng when it was not viable.  Berkeley held out the possibility of increasing the affordable housing, by later reviews determining the development's real profitability.

#### Local community speak out

Reperesentatives of the local community supported the recommendation to the commitee to refuse the application and then defend the decision at the October Inquiry.  Led by an ACA representive, Siobhan ??,  they also laid out further objections to Berkeley's proposals - LIST.  James, a trader in the Aylesham of over 5 years, said that he and and fellow traders had no idea of what was proposed, other than that the Aylesham was to be demolished.  He supported development, but it had to be for the benefit of the community.  The Rev. Dean Pusey, of St May Magdelene spoke powerfully, asking the committee to see beyond the economics of the case and look at how the development would effect the ordinary people of Peckham. The Southwark Law Centre solicitor, Jed Holloway urged the committee to broaden the grounds of their defence of the refusal, to include amongst other things, a more forthright commitment to getting the right amount of affordable housing, vague plans for the relocation of current Aylesham traderes and the adverse socio-economic impacts, such as rising rents, of the development (two of which were adopted).

#### Ward councillors speak against

Two local ward councillors, Cllrs P and Council deputy leader Cllr Ali joined in the general condemnation of Berkeley proposals and said....

#### What we think.....the Curse of the Viability Assessment

The Aylesham is a significant application, beyond its size and local importance.  As Cllr Livingstone pointed out in the planning meeting, Southwark Council has, by and large, held the line against big developers claiming that their schemes are unviable and only approved them if they deliver 35% affordable housing, including the required amount of social housing [^1].  If Berkeley succeed at appeal, that line will be broken and we can expect that other big developers to take advantage and reduce their affordable housing contributions too.

At the Inquiry, Berkeley's will no doubt rely in large part on the viability assessment which underpins the 12% affordable housing offer.  They will also emphasise that Southwark's own appraisal does not fundamentally disagree about the viability of the scheme.  Berkeley will be able to do this because the new Labour government missed the opportunity of abolishing viability assessments, in its recent changes to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).  In fact, those changes that were made, eg for building on brownfield sites, strengthen the developers' position against planning authorities and we can expect Berkeley to take full advantage [^2].

But this is still a battle that must be fought and can be won.  Local campaigners and ward councillors have shown how it can be done, by standing together at the planning committee meeting. We also have a Labour council, a Labour mayor and a Labour government all committed, they tell us, to building affordable housing.  Above all, Aylesham Community Action (ACA) and SHAPE have led the way with their marches and rallys.  ACA intend to take part in the inquiry as a Rule 6 party, to make sure that the local community has an independant voice.  This requires top-notch legal representation and the money to pay for it.  Everyone should now get behind ACA, to make sure that come October Berkeley's dreadful plans for Peckham are roundly defeated.
