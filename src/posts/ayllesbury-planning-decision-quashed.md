### Amendment to outline planning permission quashed

The legal challenge against the decision to amend the outline planning decision for the regeneration of the Aylesbury estate has succeeded.  The High Court quashed Southwark decision in its judgement last week, after a hearing last November (Links to last blog and decision).

The challenge was brought by long-term Aylesbury resident and campaigner Aysen Dennis.  Aysen(link) argued that a change to the description of the redevelopment was unlawful.  The change was made to smooth the path for a planning application by Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) for Phase 2B.  NHG holds an outline permission for the whole of the estate, including Phase 2B, which was awarded to them in 2015.  But in 2018 NHG applied for a new 'drop-in' application just for Phase 2B, because they wished to build something taller than the outline permission would allow.  Southwark decided to change the wording on the outline permission to remove any potential legal obstacles to the new application.

The change itself was to add the single word *'severable'* into the outline permission for Aylesbury development.  This would make it easier for NHG to treat the different phases and parts of the development separately, rather than as a whole.  Aysen argued that the outline permission was granted for an integrated scheme, with interconnected and interdependent parts and not for something where NHG could *“mix and match”* what was built, using different planning permissions.  Aysen submitted that while the outline permission was flexible, it also set the physical limits and parameters across the whole site, needed for a coherent scheme and was therefore not severable.

### Southwark and NHG's case

Southwark argued that the outline permission was just that - *'very outline'*.  It was not a detailed application and was for a development that would take a long period of time. On a legal point, Southwark said that what was built on one phase would be less likely to create a problem with what was built in later phases, because each was on a *'discrete area' \[with] no necessary overlap or conflict'*.  The outline permission gave Southwark and NHG *'scope.....to react to whatever has already been developed in earlier phases when considering a subsequent phase'*.  Southwark further argued that adding the word severable to the outline permission was not the main point, and *'that the key issue was whether an outline permission authorises a number of independent acts of development on spatially discrete areas of land through a phasing arrangement...'.*

NHG took part in the case as an interested party.  They addressed the same legal point as Southwark, saying that it was inappropriate to apply the reasoning of a recent Supreme Court decision on similar issues (Hillside) to this case.  In relation to this, NHG emphasised the distinction between an outline permission and a detailed decision.  and that *'there is an obvious and inherent form of severability contemplated'* in an outline permission for a phased development. 

### The judgement

The judge did not agree with Southwark and NHG.  He said that the key point was what the outline permission actually meant (what he called the scope of its *'bundle of rights')* and how had that meaning had been changed by adding of the word *'severable'* to the permission.  He ruled that this was a significant *'material'* change and should not have been made in the way that it was.  He therefore ordered that the decision to amend the outline planning decision, by adding the word *'severable'* be quashed.

In reaching his decision the judge said*, 'with respect'*, that Southwark and NHG's points about phasing and severability *'lacked coherence'.*  He showed particular concern in his reasoning about how a severed planning permission might fall foul of time limits for implementation, if it were broken into parts.  

He also notes that there would have been be nothing to stop NHG from breaking a permission down further than just into phases, if the word *'severable'* was added to the permission, saying that  *'I have strong
reservations in any event about the legality of an amendment to a planning permission which simply inserts language as uncertain as the bare term “severable”. There was nothing to indicate the extent to which the OPP \[outline permission] was purportedly severed. For a largescale development it would have been possible to conceive of many different alternatives'.*

### Why did Southwark agree to the 'drop-in' application?

Southwark Council is a partner in the Aylesbury regeneration and has a Development Partnership Agreement with NHG.  NHG has the Outline Planning Permission for the whole of the Aylesbury and the normal procedure would be for them to have submitted more detailed applications for each of the remaining phases.  Why did Southwark agree to NHG making a new and entirely different planning application for Phase 2B instead, outside of the limits of the OPP?  

### What next for Phase 2B?

The High Court decision is likely to have serious consequences for Phase 2B,  the latest of the estate's much delayed regeneration.  The 'drop-in' application was approved by the planning committee in 2018 on the understanding that the change to the outline permission would be made, protecting its validity.  Now that change has been ruled ulawful will Southwark abandon the drop-in application?  If they do what comes next?

### What about the rest of the development?

It also appears that nothing can happen on the remaing phases until Phase 2B is resolved.  In an illuminating passage of the judgement Southwark and NHG agree that Phase 2C, Phase 3 and Phase 4 can only proceed once Phase 2B is complete.  The redevelopment of the Aylesbury has been going for nearly 25 year and only a single phase has been completed.  How do Southwark and NHG intend to achieve the target date for full completion of 2035?

### Southwark and NHG - authors of their own (and our) misfortune

This is not a case where Southwark have been unwittingly tripped up by some legal technicality, as they suggest in the Southwark News (link).  The High Court case has not caused this problem - Southwark Council and NHG have.  First, by jointly putting forward a 'drop-in', detailed application for Phase 2B that did not agree with the outline permission. Second, by undertaking a planning manouvre that was supposed to protect the permissions from legal challange, but had the opposite effect.  The net result is that we have one valid, eight year old, planning permission, that should have been used to advance Phase 2B, but wasn't, and one, unvalidated permission, that must now be in doubt.
