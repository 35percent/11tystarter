The legal challenge against Southwark Council's decision to amend the outline planning decision for the regeneration of the Aylesbury estate has succeeded, with the High Court quashing the decision in its judgement last week. (Links to last blog and decision)

The challenge was brought by long-tem Aylesbury resident and campaigner Aysen Dennis, (link) who argued.....at a hearing in Nov (link).  The judge agreed, saying.......Aysen was represented by.....

The decision is likely to have serious consequences for the latest phase of the estate's much delayed and troubled regeneration.  The planning application for Phase 2B, made by developer Notting Hill Genesi ans approved by the planning committee in DATE depends upon a change made to the earlier, DATE, outline planning permission (OPP), which covers the whole estate. The change was small, but significant.  It said that the OPP was now 'severable', and so would allow an entirely different application, a so-called 'drop-in' application, to be considered for Phase 2B.  The High Court ruled that the change itself was unlawful, which puts the fate of the 'drop-in' application into doubt.
