The legal challenge against Southwark Council's decision to amend the outline planning decision for the regeneration of the Aylesbury estate has succeeded, with the High Court quashing the decision in its judgement last week. (Links to last blog and decision)

The challenge was brought by long-tem Aylesbury resident and campaigner Aysen Dennis, (link) who argued.....at a hearing in Nov (link).  The judge agreed, saying.......Aysen was represented by.....

### Questions that need answering - i/ why did Southwark agree to the 'drop-in' application?

Southwark Council isn't just the local planning authority, with the power to approve or reject NHG and other developer's planning applications.  It is itself a partner in the Aylesbury regeneration and has a Development Partnership Agreement with NHG for this.  NHG has the Outline Planning Permission for the whole of the Aylesbury and the normal procedure would be for them to have submitted more detailed applications for each of teh remaining phases.  Why did Southwark agree to NHG making a new and entirely different planning application for Phase 2B, instead, outside of the limits of the OPP?  Southwark and NHG (may) say that it is because it allows more homes to be built than the OPP, but if that is the case, where doe that leave the OPP? Is it of any use 

### Questions that need answering - ii/ what next for Phase 2B?

The decision is likely to have serious consequences for the latest phase of the estate's much delayed and troubled regeneration.  The NHG planning application for Phase 2B was  approved by the planning committee in January 2023 on the understanding that another, enirely different planning permission, the outline planning permission could still be used for the rest of the Aylesbury regenerationdepends upon a change made to the earlier, DATE, outline planning permission (OPP), which covers the whole estate. The change was small, but significant.  It said that the OPP was now 'severable', and so would allow an entirely different application, a so-called 'drop-in' application, to be considered for Phase 2B.  The High Court ruled that the change itself was unlawful, which puts the fate of the 'drop-in' application into doubt. 

### Questions that need answering - iii/ what next for rest of the development?

DPA - delayed (FOI); next Future of the Aylesbury report - delayed (screenshot); will OPP be built out by NHG?
