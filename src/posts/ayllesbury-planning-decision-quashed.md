The legal challenge against Southwark Council's decision to amend the outline planning decision for the regeneration of the Aylesbury estate has succeeded, with the High Court quashing the decision in its judgement last week. (Links to last blog and decision)

### Questions that need answering - i/ what next for Phase 2B?

The decision is likely to have serious consequences for the latest phase of the estate's much delayed and troubled regeneration.  The NHG planning application for Phase 2B was  approved by the planning committee in January 2023 on the understanding that another, enirely different planning permission, the outline planning permission could still be used for the rest of the Aylesbury regenerationdepends upon a change made to the earlier, DATE, outline planning permission (OPP), which covers the whole estate. The change was small, but significant.  It said that the OPP was now 'severable', and so would allow an entirely different application, a so-called 'drop-in' application, to be considered for Phase 2B.  The High Court ruled that the change itself was unlawful, which puts the fate of the 'drop-in' application into doubt. 

### Questions that need answering - ii/ what next for rest of the development?

DPA - delayed (FOI); next Future of the Aylesbury report - delayed (screenshot); will OPP be built out by NHG?
