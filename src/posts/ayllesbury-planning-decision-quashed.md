### Amendment to outline planning permission quashed

The legal challenge against Southwark Council's decision to amend the outline planning decision for the regeneration of the Aylesbury estate has succeeded, with the High Court quashing the decision in its judgement last week. (Links to last blog and decision)

The challenge was brought by long-tem Aylesbury resident and campaigner Aysen Dennis.  Aysen(link) argued that a change to the description of the redevelopment was unlawful.  The change was made to smooth the path for a planning application by Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) for Phase 2B.  NHG holds an outline permission for the whole of the estate, including Phase 2B, which was awarded to them in 2015.  But in 2018 NHG applied for a new 'drop-in' application just for Phase 2B, because they wished to build something taller and denser on Phase 2B than the outline permission would allow.  Southwark also decided to change the wording on the outline permission to remove any potential legal obstacles to the new application.

The change itself was to add the single word *'severable'* into the development description of the development,  This would make it easier for NHG to treat the different phases of the development seperately, rather than as one coherent whole.  Aysen argued that...

### Questions that need answering - i/ why did Southwark agree to the 'drop-in' application?

Southwark Council isn't just the local planning authority, with the power to approve or reject NHG and other developer's planning applications.  It is itself a partner in the Aylesbury regeneration and has a Development Partnership Agreement with NHG for this.  NHG has the Outline Planning Permission for the whole of the Aylesbury and the normal procedure would be for them to have submitted more detailed applications for each of the remaining phases.  Why did Southwark agree to NHG making a new and entirely different planning application for Phase 2B, instead, outside of the limits of the OPP?  Southwark and NHG (may) say that it is because would allow more homes to be built than the OPP, but if that is the case, where doe that leave the OPP? Is it of any use? 

### Questions that need answering - ii/ what next for Phase 2B?

it s hard to see how this decision will not have serious consequences for Phase 2B,  the latest phase of the estate's much delayed and troubled regeneration.  The NHG planning application for Phase 2B was approved by the planning committee in January 2023, on the understanding that another, entirely different planning permission, the outline planning permission (OPP), could still be used for the rest of the Aylesbury regeneration.  To ensure this Southwark and NHG proposed the change that the High Court has now  quashed. 

The change was small, but significant.  It said that the OPP was 'severable', and would thus allow another appliaction so-called 'drop-in' application, to be considered for Phase 2B, while keeping the OPP for the rest of the regeneration.  The High Court ruled that the change itself was unlawful, which begs the question of what becomes of the planning permission approved by the planning committee in January 2023.  According to the High Court judgement the decision notice for this permission has not been issued (presumably because Southwark were awaiting the outcome of the High Court challenge).  Will Southwark and NHG now press on with the January 2023 permission or abandon it?  If they press on , will they still be able to use the OPP for the rest of the estate regeneration? If they abandon the permission, what will they do instead on Phase 2B?

do not puts the fate of the 'drop-in' application into doubt.

It also appears as if nothing else can be built under the OPP, until Phase 2B is completed and as required by the OPP.

Judgement Para 80 “the parties agree that the OPP requires that Phase 2B has to be built before subsequent phases (i.e. Phase 3 and Phase 4) and that it is built in accordance with the OPP.”

### Questions that need answering - iii/ what about the rest of the development?

It also appears that nothing can happen on the remaing phases (Phase 2C, Phase 3 and Phase 4) until Phase 2B is resolved.  In an illuminating passage of the judgement Southwark and NHG agree that Phase 2C, Phase 3 and Phase 4 can only proceed once Phase 2B  DPA - delayed (FOI); next Future of the Aylesbury report - delayed (screenshot); will OPP be built out by NHG?

### Southark and NHG - authors of their own misfortune

The High Court case has not caused this problem (delay? See Cllr Dennis, NHG quotes,  Southwark News) - Southwark Council and NHG have.  First, by jointly agreeing to put the OPP to one side for Phase 2B, instead of making a detailed application under the terms of the OPP. Second, with a planning manouvre that was supposed to guarantee the validity of the OPP, but which fell foul of the law.  The net result is that we have one valid permission that should have been used to advance Phase 2B, but wasn't, and one, half-born, that Southwark and NHG want to use, but whose validity is now in doubt.
