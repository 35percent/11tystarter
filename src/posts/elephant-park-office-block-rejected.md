Southwark Council's planning committee rejected Lendlease's planning application for a giant office block by a unanimous 7-0 vote against the proposal last Tues (4 Oct).  The vote followed a four and half meeting, including a 50 minute closed session, when the committee considered the appliction in the abscence of the public.

The [reasons for the decision](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/g7303/Printed%20minutes%20Tuesday%2004-Oct-2022%2018.30%20Planning%20Committee.pdf?T=1) were that *'the excessive height, massing and bulk of the application would cause harm to the character and appearance of Elephant Road, Elephant Park and Walworth Road'* and that the office block *'would cause unacceptable harm to the neighbouring amenity due to loss of daylight'*, contrary to Southwark's planning policies and the Mayor's London Plan.'
