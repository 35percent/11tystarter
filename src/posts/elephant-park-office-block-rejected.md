Southwark Council's planning committee rejected Lendlease's [planning application for a giant office block](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2021-09-12-lendleases-final-plot-for-elephant-park-offices-not-homes/) on the final plot (H1) of Elephant Park, by a unanimous 7-0 vote against the proposal on Tues 4 Oct.  The vote followed a four and half meeting, including a 50 minute closed session, when the committee considered the appliction in the abscence of the public.

The [reasons for the decision](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/g7303/Printed%20minutes%20Tuesday%2004-Oct-2022%2018.30%20Planning%20Committee.pdf?T=1) were that *'the excessive height, massing and bulk of the application would cause harm to the character and appearance of Elephant Road, Elephant Park and Walworth Road'* and that the office block *'would cause unacceptable harm to the neighbouring amenity due to loss of daylight'*, contrary to Southwark's planning policies and the Mayor's London Plan.

The committee made its decison after hearing from both Lendlease and objectors, including Southwark Law Centre, the Walworth Society, the 35% Campaign and local residents.  As well as objecting to the size and design of the office block, ([double that of Lendlease's previous proposal](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2022-10-03-elephant-park-the-final-squeeze/)), objectors raised concerns about the lack of affordable retail and community space on Elephant Park, Lendlease's failure to meet onsite carbon reduction targets and the level of Elephant Park's social rents.  There was also much discussion about the the proposed health hub, a key part of the application, on what exactly would be delivered and on what terms, as well as its knock effects for Princess St and Manor Place surgeries.
