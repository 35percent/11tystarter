Lendlease's proposal to build a giant office block on the last plot (H1) of the demolished Heygate estate has been recommended for approval by Southwark Council's planning department. It now goes to the [planning committee](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7303&Ver=4) for a final decision tomorrow (Tues 4 Oct).

 If approved the office block will replace the housing that Lendlease [promised in 2012](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary), when it won planning approval for Elephant Park. As [we reported](https://www.35percent.org/posts/heygate-redevelopment-lendleases-final-squeeze/) in a previous blog, [Lendlease's original plan](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520) for H1 was to build three residential blocks, one of 30-storeys, two of ten-storeys, comprising about 300 homes.

The new office block application will be much larger than the abandoned H1 housing development.  According to the [committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s109058/Report Plot H1 Elephant Park Land bounded by Walworth Road Elephant Road Deacon Street and Sayer.pdf>) on the office block proposal, it would exceed the housing footprint and have a greater mass.

Lendlease says that it has built enough housing on the rest of Elephant Park, to allow it to build an office block on H1.  To do this more homes have been [shoehorned into fewer plots](https://www.35percent.org/posts/heygate-redevelopment-lendleases-final-squeeze/), leaving H1 as a ‘spare’ for the office development.

### The objections

Lendlease’s H1 proposal has generated over [500 comments](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=QTPPZDKB03Q00&neighbourCommentsPager.page=2), mostly objections, on a range of issues. Local campaigners and groups (including the 35% Campaign) supported by the [Southwark Law Centre](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/), have focused on the lack of affordable housing, affordable retail and community space on Elephant Park.  There are also concerns about the proposed health hub and a question mark over the levels of social rent, as well as objections to the design and size of the proposed building and shortfalls in carbon reduction.

### Use Plot H1 for more affordable housing

Plot H1 is the site of a demolished council estate and as such a brownfield site that should be optimised for housing, according to the Mayor’s [London Plan 2021](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan) policy (also called H1).

Also, while Lendlease have built 2,689 homes on Elephant Park it has only delivered 25% affordable housing and only 100 social rented homes.  Lendlease’s claim in 2012 that they could  only provide those numbers was justified by a [viability assessment](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2015-06-25-heygate-viability-assessment-finally-revealed/) that is now ten years old and which was based on 2,462 units, [two hundred and twenty-seven fewer than the 2,689](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-02-21-heygate-final-chapter-and-chance-for-southwark-to-redeem-itself/)  than has actually been built.

### The flat with a £13,854 monthly rent 

The urgent need for a new viability assessment is underscored by the sky-rocketing rents being charged by Lendlease for its latest properties – one 2-bed flat on Park Central West has just come onto the market for [£13,854 per calendar month](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/62536269/?featured=1&utm_content=featured_listing&search_identifier=837e2bfcd00e8bf07a853fd42f84d27c).

### Will there be a Health hub?

Lendlease hopes that the offer of a health hub will sweeten the office block proposal.  Under the [Southwark Plan 2022](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan) Lendlease is obliged to give over 10% of the floorspace to either *‘public health services’* or affordable workspace, in any event, so this is by no means a gift. The [committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s109058/Report Plot H1 Elephant Park Land bounded by Walworth Road Elephant Road Deacon Street and Sayer.pdf>) also reveals that the health hub is just the ‘priority option’ and so the hub will not be secured by granting the planning permission, only after further [successful negotiations](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/3E107DB92E1C2C8D981676CADEFBDA2E/pdf/21_AP_1819-LETTER_FROM_LENDLEASE_ON_HEALTH_HUB_USE-3485797.pdf) between Lendlease, Southwark and the South East London Integrated Care System (SEL ICS).

If there is a health hub it will also only have a short 30-year lease (compared to the 250-year lease granted by Lendlease to Southwark for the Walworth Library, now on Elephant Park).

A further concern is the probable loss of the Princess St and Manor Place surgeries, should the hub be built. While it would no doubt provide more up-to-date facilities than the surgeries, the impact for future local health provision and the impact on users of those existing facilities (eg in terms of potentially longer journey distances), beyond the development site, really demands a comprehensive public consultation before, not after, the determination of this application.

Objectors say no decision should be made on the Plot H1 application until all these issues are resolved, one way or another.
