Lendlease's proposal to build a giant office block on the last plot (H1) of the demolished Heygate estate has been recommended for approval by Southwark Council's planning department. It now goes to the [planning committee](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7303&Ver=4) for a final decision tomorrow (Tues 4 Oct).

 If approved the office block will replace the housing that Lendlease [promised in 2012](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary), when it won planning approval for Elephant Park. As [we reported](https://www.35percent.org/posts/heygate-redevelopment-lendleases-final-squeeze/) in a previous blog, [Lendlease's original plan](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520) for H1 was to build three residential blocks, one of 30-storeys, two of ten-storeys, comprising about 300 homes.

According to the committee report for the application the off exceeds the OPP’s footprint parameters and it also
exceeds the OPP’s massing parameters.

T﻿he new office block application exceeds 

 the size of the housing proposal.

## Housing

1. This application is the final plot of Elephant Park, on the site of the demolished
   Heygate Estate. The Applicant holds an Outline Planning Permission (OPP) to
   build homes on Plot H1. The proposal to build an office block instead of housing is
   a radical change of direction. The loss of housing that could be secured under
   the OPP, or could otherwise be built on the plot should be considered by the
   committee in determining the application.
2. The Applicant says that it has delivered all the housing required by the OPP.
   However, it has only delivered 25% affordable housing and only 100 social rented
   homes (out of 2,689 homes in total). H1 is also a brownfield site that should be
   optimised for housing, according to London Plan policy (also called H1). A fresh
   viability assessment should be conducted to establish whether the maximum
   amount of affordable housing has been delivered under the OPP.

## Health hub

3. The Applicant offers a health hub as a preferred alternative to 10% affordable
   workspace, justifying this by ‘exceptional circumstances’. However, the Applicant
   then gives a range of options, with no guarantee that a health hub will be the
   option delivered. The Application should not be approved until this is settled.
4. A second matter of concern is the short 30-year length of a health hub lease. This
   compares to the 250-year lease granted by the Applicant to Southwark for the
   Walworth Library. Should a health hub be built, the length of the lease should
   at least match that given for the Library.
5. A third concern is the probable loss of the Princess St and Manor Place surgeries,
   should the hub be built. While it will no doubt provide more up-to-date facilities than
   the surgeries, the impact for future local health provision and the impact on users
   of those existing facilities (eg in terms of potentially longer journey distances),
   beyond the development site, demands a comprehensive public consultation
   before, not after, the determination of this application.

## Community space

6. The community space provided by the Applicant is largely taken up by amenities
   (library, nursery). There is little available for the local community to let at affordable cost, for civic, social and other events. The terms for the community space
   supposedly made available for rent which has been long promised (the Trunk)
   have not been concluded. The Application should not be approved unless the
   community space is improved and leasing and letting arrangements are
   finalised.

## Design and massing

7. The Applicant proposes a building higher and twice the mass of the building
   consented under the OPP, which was designed with extensive local consultation
   which has been almost entirely absent in relation to this application. The proposed
   B1 office floorspace doubles that consented in the OPP. The proposed building
   will dominate views and reduce sunlight in Elephant Park and have severe
   negative impacts on neighbouring buildings.
8. The Design Review Panel said that the proposed building had an ‘overly bulky
   character and deep plan of design’ and as far as we are aware the proposal has
   not been returned to the Design Review Panel (DRP) for comment. The
   Application should not be approved until a referral back to the DRP has been
   made.

## Affordable retail

9. A large number of local businesses, from black and ethnic minority backgrounds,
   have been displaced by the Elephant’s regeneration and the demolition of the
   shopping centre. The Applicant has obligations under the OPP to help
   relocate some of these traders by providing affordable retail and workspace.
10. The Applicant has not yet met that obligation, supplying only 902sqm, against a
    requirement of 960sqm. While this is a relatively small amount, the requirement is
    a minimum and still leaves many traders without premises, including La Bodeguita,
    one of the Elephant’s largest independent traders. Arch 7 traders also face
    relocation. H1 should be used to help as many remaining displaced traders as
    possible. The Application should not be approved until the minimum 960sqm
    of affordable retail space is in occupation.

## Carbon reduction

11. This proposal is not compliant with the energy policy requirement to reduce CO2
    by 40%, achieving only 38%. While this may only appear to be a relatively small
    deficit, if Southwark is to reach its target of being carbon neutral by 2030 it should
    be met on-site in full. It is also a long way short of the pledge made for the
    Elephant regeneration by the then Lendlease Europe Chief Executive, as a
    founding project, under the Bill Clinton Climate Initiative, to be a Climate Positive
    Development and to strive to reduce the amount of on-site CO2 emissions to
    below zero. The Application should not be approved without a full 40% on-
    site CO2 reduction and further detailed commitments to investment in non-
    carbon energy sources.

## Social rent enforcement action

12. The Council has an outstanding enforcement action for a social rent property on
        Elephant Park, to establish whether or not the home is being properly let at a social
        rent. This raises a question about whether or not social rents are being charged
        for the hundred Elephant Park social rented units, in accordance with the OPP’s
    s106 agreement. The Application should not be approved until the
    enforcement action is resolved.
