Lendlease's proposal to build a giant office block on the last plot (H1) of the demolished Heygate estate has been recommended for approval by Southwark Council's planning department. It now goes to the [planning committee](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=7303&Ver=4) for a final decision tomorrow (Tues 4 Oct).

 If approved the office block will replace the housing that Lendlease [promised in 2012](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary), when it won planning approval for Elephant Park. As [we reported](https://www.35percent.org/posts/heygate-redevelopment-lendleases-final-squeeze/) in a previous blog, [Lendlease's original plan](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520) for H1 was to build three residential blocks, one of 30-storeys, two of ten-storeys, comprising about 300 homes.

The new office block application will be much larger than the abandoned H1 housing development.  According to the [committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s109058/Report Plot H1 Elephant Park Land bounded by Walworth Road Elephant Road Deacon Street and Sayer.pdf>) on the office block proposal, it would exceed the housing footprint and have a greater mass.

Lendlease says that it has built enough housing on the rest of Elephant Park, to allow it to build an office block on H1.  To do this more homes have been [shoehorned into fewer plots](https://www.35percent.org/posts/heygate-redevelopment-lendleases-final-squeeze/), leaving H1 as a ‘spare’ for the office development.

### The objections

Lendlease’s H1 proposal has generated over [500 comments](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=QTPPZDKB03Q00&neighbourCommentsPager.page=2), mostly objections, on a range of issues. Local campaigners and groups (including the 35% Campaign) supported by the [Southwark Law Centre](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/), have focused on the lack of affordable housing, affordable retail and community space on Elephant Park.  There are also concerns about the proposed health hub and a question mark over the levels of social rent, as well as objections to the design and size of the proposed building and shortfalls in carbon reduction.
