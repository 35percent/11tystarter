The owner of one of the Elephant and Castle's most longstanding independent traders has appealed to Southwark Council in a final effort to save his business.

Rakesh Patel, of Pricebusters DIY and hardware store, has written to Southwark's Director of Planning, the Leader of the Council, Cllr Kieron Williams and other Cabinet members.  Pricebusters had to leave the Elephant shopping centre when it was demolished.  Rakesh has asked Southwark to ensure that developers Lendlease and Delancey keep their promises and provide enough financial assistance for Pricebuster's successful relocation to Elephant Park, where he has been offered a new unit.

Rakesh has managed to raise over £550,000 himself, but now faces raising an additional £238,000.

Rakesh says 'It was a mammoth task to raise what I did.  Even when Southwark said I would have to find £238,000 more, I did my best to find it.
