The owner of one of the Elephant and Castle's most longstanding independent traders has appealed to Southwark Council in a final effort to save his business.

Rakesh Patel, of Pricebusters DIY and hardware store, has written to Southwark's Director of Planning, the Leader of the Council, Cllr Kieron Williams and other Cabinet members.  Pricebusters had to leave the Elephant shopping centre when it was demolished.  Rakesh has asked Southwark to ensure that developers Lendlease and Delancey keep their promises and provide enough financial assistance for Pricebuster's successful relocation to Elephant Park, where he has been offered a new unit.

Rakesh has managed to raise over £550,000 himself, but now faces raising an additional £238,000.

Rakesh says *'It was a mammoth task to raise what I did.  Even when Southwark said I would have to find £238,000 more, I did my best to find it.  But it is not possible for a small independent trader to get this kind of money and without it my business will be finished.'*

*'We were assured that we would get the funds we would need to relocate and that this was written into the legal s106 agreements that Southwark had with Lendlease and Delancey.  I am simply asking Southwark to enforce these agreements'.*

### Giving with one hand, taking with another

Rakesh goes on, *'Lendlease and Delancey are only offering a fraction of the total relocation costs, despite the legal agreements.  Lendlease's offer of £200,000 is for me to do the work that they should have done themselves, to bring the unit up to a basic standard.  They also said that I can have £160,00 upfront, but I have to accept a higher rent to the value of that amount when I move in.  Lendlease giving with one hand, only to take away with the other.*
