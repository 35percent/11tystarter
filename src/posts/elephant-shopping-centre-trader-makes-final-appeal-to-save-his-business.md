The owner of one of the Elephant and Castle's most longstanding independent traders has appealed to Southwark Council in a final effort to save his business.

Rakesh Patel, of Pricebusters DIY and hardware store, has written to Southwark's Director of Planning, the Leader of the Council, Cllr Kieron Williams and other Cabinet members.  Pricebusters had to leave the Elephant shopping centre when it was demolished.  Rakesh has asked Southwark to ensure that developers Lendlease and Delancey keep their promises and provide enough financial assistance for Pricebuster's successful relocation to Elephant Park, where he has been offered a new unit.

Rakesh has managed to raise over £550,000 himself, but now faces raising an additional £238,000.

Rakesh says *'It was a mammoth task to raise what I did.  Even when Southwark said I would have to find £238,000 more, I did my best to find it.  But it is not possible for a small independent trader to get this kind of money and without it my business will be finished.'*

*'We were assured that we would get the funds we would need to relocate and that this was written into the legal s106 agreements that Southwark had with Lendlease and Delancey.  I am simply asking Southwark to enforce these agreements'.*

### Giving with one hand, taking with another

Rakesh goes on, *'Lendlease and Delancey are only offering a fraction of the total relocation costs, despite the legal agreements.  Lendlease's offer of £200,000 is for me to do the work that they should have done themselves, to bring the unit up to a basic standard.  They also said that I can have £160,00 upfront, but I have to accept a higher rent to the value of that amount when I move in.  Lendlease giving with one hand, only to take away with the other.*

Delancey is offering £192,000, but Rakesh says *'This is nowhere near enough, because the relocation costs are so high. I am not asking for a handout; I will be putting everything I have into this.  I have itemised everything in my budget to Delancey and they are all things that  we were told there would be funds for, under the legal agreement.  I proposed that we divide the costs more or less equally between myself, Lendlease and Delancey.  I think that this is fair and I wanted Southwark to support this, but instead they asked me to accept Lendlease's and Delancey's offers, leaving me with a massive bill I simply cannot meet.'*

Rakesh has not given up all hope.  He said *'I am appealing to Southwark to live up to their pledge that no-one would be left behind in the Elephant's regeneration.  We were in the shopping centre for 35 years and had a comfortable business that supported six families, before we were forced to close for the demolition.  We have been unable to trade for a year since then, while negotiations with Delancey and Lendlease have been going on.  I just want to get Pricebusters up and running again and am depending on Southwark Council being true to their word to do this.'*
