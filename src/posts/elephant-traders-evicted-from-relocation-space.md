The Southwark News has reported that small traders at the Elephant Arcade are to be evicted.  The traders were relocated to the Arcade, a converted indoor carpark at the bottom of council block Perronet House, when they were displaced in 2020, by the demolition and redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle Shoppin Centre.

SN reports that Southwark Council says.....

Latin Elephant say.......

### What we say

The closure of these businesses due to a lack of customers should can come as no surprise to Southwark Council or anyone else.  Latin Elephant noted the risk of low footfall in its recent assessment of the impact of the relocation of the businesses from the shopping centre, in Sept 2020.  This also relates the challenges of the Covid pandemic, adding to that of ‘re-building’ a customer base in out-of-the way sites.

Elephant Arcade is one of the three relocation sites for displaced traders from the shopping centre.  It has xx businesses who have been established form 5 to tenwty plus years.

It is also telling that the two businesses that are visible from the street, the Black Cowboy café and Lucy’s hairdressers are in good health. 

Replacing these businesses with a Latin community centre may also seem like a worthy idea, but it is compromised when it is in space which small businesses have had to vacate, because of what has to be seen as a failure of the relocation process.

The local community and housing campaigners fought hard to get some mitigating benefits from the redevelopment of the shopping centre and succeeded in securing temporary space for traders, plus relocation funding.  But we must see now that it has sadly failed the traders who moved to what was Perronet’s car-park.

Southwark’s policy has improved since then, but in practice how local businesses can be accommodated in new developments is still too much of an afterthought and leaves them pushed to the margins.  A test that something better can be done will be the treatment of the Mercato traders. The fears of Old Kent Rd businesses have been well-rehearsed ever since the Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area was announced. .  PLUSHLatin and all the other small traders were amn afterthought 
One lesson that should be learned it that must stop pushing businesses we already have to the margins

and the risk posed by relocation to hidden areas with low footfall.
