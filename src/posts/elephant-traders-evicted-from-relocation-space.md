The [Southwark News has reported](https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/elephant-and-castle/traders-evicted-from-elephant-and-castle-shopping-arcade-as-private-landlord-hands-back-control-of-struggling-retail-space-to-southwark-council/) that the small traders at the Elephant Arcade are to be evicted.  The traders were relocated to the Arcade,  when they were displaced in 2020, by the demolition and redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle Shoppin Centre.  The Arcade is a converted indoor carpark at the bottom of council housing block, Perronet House. 

Around six traders have been told by the Arcade's operator, [Meanwhile Space](https://www.meanwhilespace.com/), that they will have to leave by the end of August.  Two traders, the [Black Cowboy Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/blackcowboycoffee/?hl=en) and [Lucy's Hair and Beauty](https://www.lucyhairandbeauty.com/), which have both established successful businesses in the Arcade, will remain, with Southwark Council as their new landlords.

Traders who spoke to Southwark News said that lack of custom and low footfall has left them struggling to make a profit.  House of Trainers owner,Al Hussein had been trading at the Elephant for 15 years.  He said people did not know that there were businesses in the Arcade and were critical of of Meanwhile Space for not providing better signage.

Latin Elephant say.......

### What we say

The lose of these traders mark a falure of Southwark Council's relocation policy for traders and businesses displaced by development and regeneration[^x].  

Anyone familiar with the Elephant will know that the bottom of Perronet House was far from an ideal relocation site and that it was always going to be difficult for shops to attract custom, when they are tucked away out of sight of passing pedestrians.  Both Southwark Council and Meanwhile Space should have recognised this and done much more to support the traders in the Elephant Arcade.  It's noteworthy that the two businesses that have successfully re-established themselves are not only an excellent cafe and hairdresser, but are also completely visible to anyone walking by on the street.

The traders themselves were well aware of thproblems of their situation and repeatedly asked for improved signage and other changes, but to no avail, as our good friends Latin Elephant have noted in their comments to Southwark News.  Latin Elephant also noted the risk of low footfall in its recent assessment of the impact of the shopping centre traders' relocation  \[LINK].  

No-one can say for certain that all the traders would have prospered if their request had been met , but given that they had already a track-record of trading in the area, before they were relocated, they would at least have had a better chance of success.     

The local community and housing campaigners fought hard to get some mitigating benefits from the redevelopment of the shopping centre and succeeded in securing temporary space for traders, plus relocation funding.Elephant Arcade is one of the three relocation sites for displaced traders from the shopping centre; a second Elephant Square.  It has xx businesses who have been established form 5 to tenwty plus years.



Replacing these businesses with a Latin community centre may also seem like a worthy idea, but it is compromised when it is in space which small businesses have had to vacate, because of what has to be seen as a failure of the relocation process.

  But we must see now that it has sadly failed the traders who moved to what was Perronet’s car-park.

  Southwark’s policy has improved since then, but in practice how local businesses can be accommodated in new developments is still too much of an afterthought and leaves them pushed to the margins.  A test that something better can be done will be the treatment of the Mercato traders. The fears of Old Kent Rd businesses have been well-rehearsed ever since the Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area was announced. .  PLUSHLatin and all the other small traders were amn afterthought 
One lesson that should be learned it that must stop pushing businesses we already have to the margins
