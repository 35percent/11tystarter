NHG have abandoned the Outline Permission for Phase 2B for reasons that will equally apply to all the remaining phases 2C, 3, and 4 - ie that they cannot be build within the OPP's masterplan's timescale and they cannot reprovide the lost affordable housing floorspace \[REF].

NHG also appears to have abandoned any attempt to protect the legal validity of the Outline Permission. This was one of the aims behind NHG's proposal, supported by Southwark, to change the Outline Permission's wording. A legal challenge was quashed in the High Court, leaving the OPP legally vulnerable. NHG and Southwark Council have also abandoned the attempt to protect the validity of the OPP for future phases.

Quote from Southwark Law Centre *'I have deep concerns about the legal consequences of this development going ahead, in light of the Hillside case (as confirmed by Dennis). My understanding is that, if this application were granted and development began pursuant to it, it would render any further development under the OPP (on other Phases) unlawful. In other words, it would stop all future development across the Aylesbury, and would require a whole new masterplan permission to be sought. I am concerned that the Council have not fully recognised this, or there is an ulterior consideration that is being kept secretâ€¦*

It looks as if we can only look forward to piecemeal development, without the integrity promised by the AAAP, fo as long as NHG are in control of the regeneration. It is clear that NHG will not be delivering the regeneration as promised to residents and the local community, as described in the AAAP, and as 
If NHG cannot deliver the regeneration promised under the AAAP it should be taken from them

#### NHG's record - number of social rented units delivered by NHG

The updated Phase application has a long explanation of what has been built by so far which reveals how little social rented housing NHG has provided.

The figures provided in two tables of the completed phases omits to say who actually provided the social rented homes.

The figures for the FDS also omit to say it is in three parts, FDS A, B & C and that NHG are only responsible for FDC C.

When this information is added the 'scorecard' looks like this;

FDS C - 56, Plot 18 - 23; total 79 - table of social rent delivered to date  L&Q 148 ; Southwark - 581; NHG - 79

FDS C - 56, Plot 18 - 23; Phase 2B - 173; total 252

Leaving aside whether or not there will be more social rent floorspace - when the number of demolished homes is taken into account, after ten years and assuming that Phase 2B will get built (more 172 not yet built) we will have still have 75 fewer social rented homes from NHG than we have already (327 minus 252 = 75)

They only refer to the High Court case that quashed an attempt to amend the OPP in passing
