At least four social housing units have been lost to Southwark from the showpiece replacement housing site built for Heygate estate residents, displaced by the estate’s demolition a decade ago.


Garland Court, on Wansey St, at the Elephant and Castle, should have provided at least 16 new social rented homes for Heygate council tenants, who lost their homes to allow for the redevelopment of the estate as Elephant Park by the private developer, Lendlease.


However, Land Registry documents reveal that nineteen of the 31 units are now privately owned, leaving just eleven for affordable housing.

#### Affordable housing agreed with housing association


Garland Court sits on what was a council owned carpark, just behind the former Walworth Town Hall. Southwark Council [resolved to sell the land to the Southern Housing Group in 2004](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Minutes.pdf) on the condition that 16 of the new homes should be social rented, with a further three homes being part-buy/part let.

 [The Executive committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Item 18 - Site known asthe Wansey Street car park, Wansey Street, SE17 - Disposal.pdf>) says that terms had been *‘provisionally agreed’* with Southern Housing Group, including that 19 of the units would be affordable housing, 16 of which were to be general needs rent, three to be shared-ownership, with 12 units of private housing.  The Council would also have 100% nomination rights for the initial general needs tenants and then 75% of 2-bed, and 50% of 1-bed, for a period of 80 years.  There would be 6x1-bed, 4x2-bed, 6x3-bed ‘social housing units’ (para 8).

The report further stated that there had been consultations with the TRA and residents of the Heygate estate and that *‘The development would be an exemplar for the main programme of Early Housing Sites and would enable some limited decant of the Heygate Estate to commence’* (para 3).


The Strategic Director of Housing advised that Wansey St *‘was that a key early component of the housing provision to meet the needs of tenants to be decanted from the Heygate Estate’* and *‘Rent and service charges are governed by the guidelines for affordability set out in the Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance’* and *‘All the initial nominations will be to households being decanted from Heygate Estate; thereafter, lettings will be in accordance with the SOUHAG (Southwark Housing Associations’ Group) agreement which is summarised in paragraph 8’* (para 18, 19).
