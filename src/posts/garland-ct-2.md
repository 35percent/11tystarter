At least four social housing units have been lost to Southwark from the showpiece replacement housing site built for Heygate estate residents, displaced by the estate’s demolition a decade ago.


Garland Court, on Wansey St, at the Elephant and Castle, should have provided at least 16 new social rented homes for Heygate council tenants, who lost their homes to allow for the redevelopment of the estate as Elephant Park by the private developer, Lendlease.


However, Land Registry documents reveal that nineteen of the 31 units are now privately owned, leaving just eleven for affordable housing.

#### Affordable housing agreed with housing association


Garland Court sits on what was a council owned carpark, just behind the former Walworth Town Hall. Southwark Council [resolved to sell the land to the Southern Housing Group](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Item 18 - Site known asthe Wansey Street car park, Wansey Street, SE17 - Disposal.pdf>) in 2004 on the condition that 16 of the new homes should be social rented, with a further three homes being part-buy/part let.

 [The Executive committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Item 18 - Site known asthe Wansey Street car park, Wansey Street, SE17 - Disposal.pdf>) says that terms had been *‘provisionally agreed’* with Southern Housing Group, including that 19 of the units would be affordable housing, 16 of which were to be general needs rent, three to be shared-ownership, with 12 units of private housing.  The Council would also have 100% nomination rights for the initial general needs tenants and then 75% of 2-bed, and 50% of 1-bed, for a period of 80 years.  There would be 6x1-bed, 4x2-bed, 6x3-bed ‘social housing units’ (para 8).
