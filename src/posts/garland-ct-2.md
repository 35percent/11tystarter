Site development, tenures and land
1	The site of Garland Ct is a former council owned carpark, on the south side of Wansey St, lying between a row of terraced houses and the Walworth Town Hall.  The north side of the street formed the edge of the Heygate estate.
2	Southwark Council resolved to sell the carpark land for an undisclosed sum at its [Executive meeting on the 14 Dec 2004](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Minutes.pdf) (Executive meeting minutes, Item 18).	 
3	The [Executive committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Item 18 - Site known asthe Wansey Street car park, Wansey Street, SE17 - Disposal.pdf>) says that the housing association  Southern Housing Group had been chosen to develop the site.  The terms ‘provisionally agreed’ with Southern were that 19 of the units would be affordable housing, 16 of which were to be general needs rent, three to be shared-ownership, with 12 units of private housing.  The Council would also have 100% nomination rights for the initial general needs tenants and then 75% of 2-bed, and 50% of 1-bed, for a period of 80 years.  There would be 6x1-bed, 4x2-bed, 6x3-bed ‘social housing units’. (para 8)4	The report further stated that there had been consultations with the TRA and residents of the Heygate estate  and that ‘The development would be an exemplar for the main programme of Early Housing Sites and would enable some limited decant of the Heygate Estate to commence.’ (para 3)
5	The Strategic Director of Housing advised that Wansey St ‘was that a key early component of the housing provision to meet the needs of tenants to be decanted from the Heygate Estate’ and ‘Rent and service charges are governed by the guidelines for affordability set out in the Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance’ and ‘All the initial nominations will be to households being decanted from Heygate Estate; thereafter, lettings will be in accordance with the SOUHAG (Southwark Housing Associations’ Group) agreement which is summarised in paragraph 8.’ (para 18, 19)
6	The transfer of land document agreed between the Council and Southern Housing Group shows that the land was sold for £1.  It requires that the ‘Transferee shall ensure that the Social Housing Units shall only be used for Social Housing’ (13.5.1); that they ‘are let in accordance with the provisions of the Nominations agreement’(13.5.2).  The total number of ‘Social Housing Units’ should be in accordance with ‘clause 21 of an Agreement for Lease’, between  the parties, dated 26 May 2005 (13.1.5; 13.1.6). (Hard copy of document only).
