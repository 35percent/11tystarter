At least four social housing units have been lost to Southwark from the showpiece replacement housing development built for Heygate estate residents, displaced by the estate’s demolition a decade ago.


Garland Court, on Wansey St, at the Elephant and Castle, should have provided at least 16 new social rented homes for Heygate council tenants, who lost their homes to allow for the redevelopment of the estate as Elephant Park by the private developer, Lendlease.


However, Land Registry documents reveal that nineteen of the 31 units are now privately owned, leaving just eleven for affordable housing.

#### Affordable housing agreed with housing association


Garland Court sits on what was a council owned carpark, just behind the former Walworth Town Hall. Southwark Council [resolved to sell this land to the Southern Housing Group in 2004](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Minutes.pdf), on the condition that 16 of the new homes should be social rented, with a further three homes being part-buy/part let.

 [The Executive committee report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20041214/Agenda/Item 18 - Site known asthe Wansey Street car park, Wansey Street, SE17 - Disposal.pdf>) says that terms had been *‘provisionally agreed’* with Southern Housing Group, including that 19 of the units would be affordable housing, 16 of which were to be general needs rent, three to be shared-ownership, with 12 units of private housing.  The Council would also have 100% nomination rights for the initial general needs tenants and then 75% of 2-bed, and 50% of 1-bed, for a period of 80 years.  There would be 6x1-bed, 4x2-bed, 6x3-bed ‘social housing units’ (para 8).

The report further stated that there had been consultations with the TRA and residents of the Heygate estate and that *‘The development would be an exemplar for the main programme of Early Housing Sites and would enable some limited decant of the Heygate Estate to commence’* (para 3).


The Strategic Director of Housing advised that Wansey St *‘was that a key early component of the housing provision to meet the needs of tenants to be decanted from the Heygate Estate’* and *‘Rent and service charges are governed by the guidelines for affordability set out in the Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance’* and *‘All the initial nominations will be to households being decanted from Heygate Estate; thereafter, lettings will be in accordance with the SOUHAG (Southwark Housing Associations’ Group) agreement which is summarised in paragraph 8’* (para 18, 19).

#### Land sold for £1

The transfer of land document agreed between the Council and Southern Housing Group shows that the land was sold for £1.  It requires that the ‘Transferee shall ensure that the Social Housing Units shall only be used for Social Housing’ (13.5.1); that they ‘are let in accordance with the provisions of the Nominations agreement’ (13.5.2).  The total number of ‘Social Housing Units’ should be in accordance with ‘clause 21 of an Agreement for Lease’, between the parties, dated 26 May 2005 (13.1.5; 13.1.6).

#### Garland Court’s Planning Permission

A planning application was duly made on 15 Nov 2004 ([04/AP/2114](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV2EKBWR512&activeTab=summary)) and [planning permission](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/42B1169A9A7CE9D048A133688E5CB8FF/04_AP_2114--48162.rtf) was granted to Southern Housing Group for 31 apartments on 10 Feb 2005.  The twelfth of the thirteen conditions is that *‘The 19 units allocated for affordable housing shall be developed by a social housing group approved by the local planning authority’.*

In February 2013 Southwark Council’s Statement of Case for a Heygate CPO inquiry listed Wansey St as one of the early re-housing sites for Heygate residents, delivering 15 (not 16) social rented units.

#### The ownership of Garland Court’s flats

Garland Court was completed in 2006 and its distinctive orange-hued design by Architects drMM was shortlisted for a RIBA Award and the Grand Designs Magazine Awards.  The Land Registry shows 31 flats listed at the Garland Ct. address and the the title registers for each flat further show that eighteen are in private ownership, with one owned by a church trust.

#### What we think...

If nineteen of Garland Court’s 31 flats are in private ownership, then simple arithmetic tells us that there cannot be sixteen social rented units. At most there could be twelve, if all the remainder are social rent, but we cannot know for sure because three shared-ownership flats must be accounted for too.\
Four lost units is not a large number but it is a high proportion of this development, with a high free-market value.  Garland Court, while relatively small, was nonetheless a high-profile development that was to house ex-Heygate residents and after that those from Southwark’s housing waiting list.  Southwark cannot afford to lose any social rented homes, however small the number.

Garland Court also cannot be found in Southwark Council’s rolling [audit of affordable housing delivery](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODIzNTdiMGUtMDAxNS00NGI1LThjY2EtYjBjMWQwYzcxMzQ2IiwidCI6ImNhZjg2Y2IxLThjYTItNDU0NS1hNGRkLWYzNTlkMDM5MGEwOCJ9&pageName=ReportSection__;!!Ou-zFulSALS7ubxZ2oj45Dg!Vqi3bagEzmK7icBcQgGm18ZQk8FHJAYsCVjB_M_V6G6fzAaRhemokxPlAzcnrCU09xxdfdKYI2SsLLc63Oa-DmfMFJGVKA$).  Our last blogpost was about the high rents being charged for housing that is nominally social rent, highlighting Gutenberg Court in Bermondsey.  We said that this undermines Southwark’s claim that it has an effective monitoring system of affordable housing delivery in place.  Garland Court lends weight to that argument.


Southwark Law Centre has taken up the issue of Gutenberg Court with Southwark Council and we have shared the details of Garland Court with them, so that they can do likewise with this case.
