Southwark Councilâ€™s [decision to refuse](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=65131) Lendlease planning permission for a large office block on H1, the final plot of Elephant Park (formerly the Heygate estate) has been [overturned by a planning inspector](https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?Caseid=3319797&CoID=0).  The decision means that Lendlease can go ahead with construction of the office block.
