Southwark Council’s [decision to refuse](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=65131) Lendlease planning permission for a large office block on H1, the final plot of Elephant Park (formerly the Heygate estate) has been [overturned by a planning inspector](https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?Caseid=3319797&CoID=0).  The decision means that Lendlease can go ahead with construction of the office block.

The decision comes after an [eight-day public inquiry in September](https://gateleyhamer-pi.com/en-gb/h1-elephant-park/), before Inspector Paul Griffiths, appointed by the Secretary of State for Homes, Communities and Levelling Up, Michael Gove.  Southwark and the Community Objectors H1 (COH1) argued to maintain the planning committee’s decision, which [refused the scheme](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=65131) in October 2022, because of its size, the detrimental impact it would have on the light and privacy of neighbours and harm it would cause to the character of the area.  COH1 argued in addition that the H1 site should be used for housing, not offices, as the original outline planning permission, held by Lendlease required.  Southwark Council had no objection to an office block in principle.

The 35% Campaign was part of COH1, which included local residents, housing campaigners and the Walworth Society.  COH1 were represented by the [Public Interest Law](https://www.pilc.org.uk/) Centre (PILC), the Southwark Law Centre’s [Planning Voice Project](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/planning-voice/) and barrister [Charles Bishop](https://www.landmarkchambers.co.uk/barristers/charles-bishop) of Landmark Chambers.

### What the Inspector thought….

Contrary to Southwark and COH1 [the Inspector found](https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?Caseid=3319797&CoID=0) that the office block’s shape would be a *‘pleasing’* contrast to the rectilinear forms of the rest of Elephant Park and would provide a focus for the development and for the wider Elephant & Castle regeneration.  He considered the design to be of a very high standard.  He thought that the design features, such as the lattice work of fins, the terracing and the *‘ripples’* in the façade, would counteract any impression of oversized bulkiness.  He further thought that the high ground floor lobby, with restaurant/cafes, would amount to an extension of the outside public space, with the proposed NHS health hub giving the building a sense of destination.

The Inspector acknowledged that there would be harm to the light of neighbours on Walworth Terrace, just over the road from H1, and in Hurlock Heights on Elephant Park, noting that there would be ‘significant reductions in daylight’ for Nos.82-96 Walworth Road and for ‘all the single aspect north facing master bedrooms in the lower part of Hurlock Heights’.  Against this, though, there was a ‘policy expectation’ of a big building on H1, which meant the loss of light was ‘not surprising or extreme’ and therefore acceptable.   He also did not think changing the use of the site from a residential to office development made much difference in terms of privacy.
