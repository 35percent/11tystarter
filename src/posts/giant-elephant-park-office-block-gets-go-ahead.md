Southwark Council’s [decision to refuse](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=65131) Lendlease planning permission for a large office block on H1, the final plot of Elephant Park (formerly the Heygate estate) has been [overturned by a planning inspector](https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?Caseid=3319797&CoID=0).  The decision means that Lendlease can go ahead with construction of the office block.

The decision comes after an [eight-day public inquiry in September](https://gateleyhamer-pi.com/en-gb/h1-elephant-park/), before Inspector Paul Griffiths, appointed by the Secretary of State for Homes, Communities and Levelling Up, Michael Gove.  Southwark and the Community Objectors H1 (COH1) argued to maintain the planning committee’s decision, which [refused the scheme](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=65131) in October 2022, because of its size, the detrimental impact it would have on the light and privacy of neighbours and harm it would cause to the character of the area.  COH1 argued in addition that the H1 site should be used for housing, not offices, as the original outline planning permission, held by Lendlease required.  Southwark Council had no objection to an office block in principle.

The 35% Campaign was part of COH1, which included local residents, housing campaigners and the Walworth Society.  COH1 were represented by the [Public Interest Law](https://www.pilc.org.uk/) Centre (PILC), the Southwark Law Centre’s [Planning Voice Project](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/planning-voice/) and barrister Charles Bishop of Landmark Chambers.
