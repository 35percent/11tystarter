£480m of public money has been spent on the Aylesbury estate regeneration before the first council home on the first phase has even been completed.

That's ££ per dwelling for the 750 homes demolished on the estate to date. Elsewhere on the estate the Council has just refurbished 80 homes which cost just £10k per dwelling.



Aylesbury estate was selected by Tony Blair for his \[first speech as prime minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blairs-pledge-to-the-dark-estates-1253883.html) on 2nd June 1997, where he made his 'forgotten people' speech, \[saying](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0602/blair.shtml) there must be no more \_"no-hope areas"\_ in new Labour's Britain.

Blair vowed to \_'learn from the mistakes of the past'\_ and replace the dogma of bygone housing policies with pragmatism and common sense. The estate's regeneration was subsequently initiated as part of New Labour's '\[Urban Task Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towards_an_Urban_Renaissance)' inner-city renewal programme. The project was subsequently awarded £56m funding under the \['New Deal for Communities'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_for_Communities) partnership and regeneration plans were drawn up to transfer the estate to a housing association for redevelopment.

The plan was that replacement social housing would be funded by the profits of building a mix of private homes on the redeveloped estate. Southwark calculated that the cost to the Council would be 'broadly neutral' [link] also here to annex c.
