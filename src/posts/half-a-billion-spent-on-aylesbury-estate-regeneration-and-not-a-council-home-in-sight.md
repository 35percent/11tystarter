£456m of public money has been spent on the Aylesbury estate regeneration before the first council home on the first phase has even been completed.[^1]

The cross subsidy it will receive from the sale of the private homes once phase one is completed amounts to just £8.7m

That's a cost of £608k per dwelling for the 750 homes demolished on the estate to date. 

This is a far cry from the Council's original forecasts, which said the scheme would be entirely funded by the profits of building a mix of private homes on the redeveloped estate. Southwark calculated that the cost to the Council would be 'broadly neutral'. Its [Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050927/Agenda/Item%2007%20-%20The%20AylesburyEstate%20Revised%20Strategy%20-%20Report.pdf) approving the redevelopment in 2005 said this:

It even produced a detailed [costing](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/annexc.pdf) showing a small deficit of around £7m for the whole scheme.

In the event costs have ballooned

Elsewhere on the estate the Council has just refurbished 80 homes at a cost just £10k per dwelling.

Southwark Council has always argued that it simply didn't have enough money to refurbish the estate..

## Too big to fail
Aylesbury estate was selected by Tony Blair for his \[first speech as prime minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blairs-pledge-to-the-dark-estates-1253883.html) on 2nd June 1997, where he made his 'forgotten people' speech, \[saying](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0602/blair.shtml) there must be no more \_"no-hope areas"\_ in new Labour's Britain.

Blair vowed to \_'learn from the mistakes of the past'\_ and replace the dogma of bygone housing policies with pragmatism and common sense. The estate's regeneration was subsequently initiated as part of New Labour's '\[Urban Task Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towards_an_Urban_Renaissance)' inner-city renewal programme. The project was subsequently awarded £56m funding under the \['New Deal for Communities'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_for_Communities) partnership and regeneration plans were drawn up to transfer the estate to a housing association for redevelopment.

__Footnotes:__ 
[^1]: The first public funding spent on the scheme was the £56m from the government’s NDC (New Deal for Communities) programme.

The scheme was subsequently allocated 46m from the government’s Estate Regeneration Fund and £27m from GLA funding to date (see source [here](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s52526/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Update.pdf)), plus £13m of HCA funding, which helped build the completed phase 1a of the scheme (see source on page 20 of the [this document](https://35percent.org/img/Estate-Regen-Sourcebook-Web-Version.pdf)).

In addition, the Council has spent a considerable amount of its own HRA account funds on the scheme. This [Jan 2022 Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report%20Future%20of%20Aylesbury%20Estate.pdf) shows that £65.42m of HRA funds have been spent to date(para 18) and releases a further £29.8m for ongoing acquisitions of leaseholders (para 43).

This comes after the Council's [decision](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-07-09-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) in 2020 to spend £193m just in order to complete the first phase of the scheme alone, after its development partner said it wouldn't proceed on the agreed basis.

There is also the £35m cost to the Council of building the replacement library and health centre (see para 10 of [this Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s71667/Report%20Aylesbury%20Estate%20Community%20facilities%20at%20Plot%2018%20Delivery.pdf)). Note that Notting Hill Genesis is contributing £3m towards the cost of these so the overall cost to the Council is £32m.

Note also that Southwark will receive a Land payment from Notting Hill Genesis amounting to £5.7m.

Taking this into account a total of £456.5m of public funds has been spent just in order to complete the first of four phases of the estate's redevelopment.
