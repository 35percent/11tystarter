### Background - timeline

1997          Blair Labour government elected

1999          Southwark Council secure New Deal for Communities grant of £52m, over ten years, for the Aylesbury estate.  A further £400m is anticipated as part of a stock transfer to a housing association and a demolition/redevelopment programme

2001           A ballot of estate residents rejects stock transfer; 73% voting against the proposal, on a 73% turn-out.

2002           Council decides to retain and refurbish stock.

Jan - April 2003         An Options Appraisal exercise carried out in the southwest corner of the estate (to be later known as Phase 1 – Site 1a) by Levitt Bernstein and Pollard Thomas Edwards Architects.

Sept 2005    Council initiates a redevelopment strategy for a *'high quality, mixed tenurre urban area, subject to...full financial assessments'*; a detailed project plan, with timescales, milesones and resource implications to be completed by the end of the year.

Dec 2005     Walworth Community Council considers outline planning permission for demolition Aylesbury Day Centre, garages and outbuildings, Boyson Rd, Bradenham Close and construction of 125 new dwellings, on south-west corner (05-CO-0161), in advance of planning committee meeting in 2006.

Jan 2006       Permission for 05-CO-0161 (south west corner) granted.

May 2006      Work on south west corner suspended because of health and safety concerns about the design of the day centre.  New design commissioned within an enlarged scheme.

Sept 2006      Council's medium term financial strategy includes exploiting *'opportunities afforded through the regeneration programme, including setting a target for capital receipts from regeneration projects to support the Council’s future capital programme’*.  Southwark's 3-year £455m programme includes a new Aylesbury Resource Centre as a priority.

Nov 2006       The Executive approves procurement of a Registered Social Landlord (RSL) / developer for south west corner site (Phase 1a).  Site enlarged, by demolishing 1 - 41 Bradenham, 1-12 Red Lion Close and commercial units 6-28 Westmoreland Road.  Number of dwellings increased by 150, from 125, to approximately 270 units.  The additional 150 to be RSL housing for rent and for sale, split to be determined. Development will be funded by the appointed RSL, commuted land value and by London Housing Board funding, previously agreed for the former south-west corner scheme revenues. The new resource centre to be funded by a Health and Social Care bid for £5.7 million (to be considered by the Executive in November 2006.  There are *‘..no anticipated implications for the Housing Investment Programme….’*  

June 2007	Planning committee approves ‘council own’ outline planning application 07-CO-0046, Westmoreland Rd, Red Lion Row, Bradenham, Phase 1a Aylesbury regeneration.  Supercedes 05-CO-0161. All (53) existing social rented units to be reprovided. Of the 207 additional units, 37.7% would be affordable; 62.8% to be social rented and 37.2% to be intermediate. The overall tenure mix will be is 34.6% social rented, 11.1% intermediate and 54.2% market (hab. rooms); 90 social rent units, 29 inter units. 90% of the homes will be 1/2 bed.

Dec 2007	The strategic director of regeneration and neighbourhoods formally declared Phase 1a surplus to requirements. 

Jan 2008	         The strategic director for major projects approves formal agreement with L&Q housing association for the development of Phase 1a, for provision of 260 units of housing and the Aylesbury Resource Centre (ARC).  The land is to be sold on a 130 year lease for an undisclosed amount. The affordable housing *‘will reflect the generous space standards of the existing estate’*. 

 June 2008	 The Council's Major Projects Board recommends to the Assembly that an application is made to the SoS (DCLG) for consent to the transfer and disposal of the south west corner land (Phase 1a); the consent is needed because the undisclosed proposed receipt from L&Q is less than open market value.  L&Q is to add an undisclosed *‘added value’* contribution for *‘social infrastructure’* (eg employment) and will meet higher than minimum design, build and space standards.  The undisclosed cost of building the ARC to be funded from the Health and social care department’s allocation in the Council’s capital programme.  The cost of acquiring the twelve residential and six commercial leaseholds (planning report 07-CO-0046) will be met by the capital programme.  No provision is made for meeting costs from HRA or General Fund costs.  The social rent tenancies on the completed development will *‘be a minimum of the council’s existing tenancy conditions’*, with the right to acquire.

 July 2008	  The Council Assembly approves the Major Board recommendation, for application to SoS, after public and press were excluded from the discussion, a decision challenged by opposition councillors.  A successful 2023 FOI request (Southwark ref 18871362) for the Closed Assembly report shows that the land was sold for £3m, against a valuation of £9.8m.   

2008-2009          Southwark drafts the Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAAP).  This is *‘a spatial plan that combines land use planning policies with an employment strategy, a health and services strategy, a transport strategy, an open spaces strategy and a business and delivery plan, to create a holistic plan for the regeneration of the estate and surrounding area’*.  The AAAP is judged to be sound by a government appointed Inspector, after an Examination in Public in September 2009.  Recommended changes include increasing the phase one affordable housing, and reducing the private housing, to gain HCA funding and make it viable, while reducing the affordable housing and increasing the private housing by the same amount in the final phase four.  The capital programme is set at £1.2bn with a funding shortfall of £169m.

Oct 2009	           The Executive approves the joint procurement of development and housing association partners with the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) for the four Phase 1 sites - Site 1a, a second south west corner site (later known as the FDS), the small Amersham site, in the centre of the estate, and the North Wolverton site (later known as Site 7), at the north east corner of the estate. It also approves the phased re-housing of Phase 1 residents and instructs officers to explore all possible external funding sources, including Social Housing Grant.

HCA funding of £13m for Phase 1a was *‘effectively unlocked’*.  Southwark's was making a business case for government Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding of Phase 2 & 3 (which along with Phase 1 would cover about half of the estate's redevelopment).

The estate land is in council’s freehold ownership.  The strategy for the requied vacant possession was to demolish the worst blocks first; accommodate displaced households on-site and off-site; acquire leaseholder properties and  meeting the desire of residents to remain on the estate.  The estate residents were secure council tenants and private owners who have bought Right to Buy (RTB) homes, plus number of businesses-leased properties.  All leaseholder interests were to be bought out. (Non-secure tenants? Date of ending secure tenancies?)

The re-housing of residents was programmed to be completed by 2023, with the full redevelopment of 4,209 new homes scheduled to be completed by 2027 - Phase 1a by 2013; Phase 1 by 2016; Phase 2 by 2018; Phase 3 by 2020;  Phase 4 by 2027.

 

Dec 2009          The Council Executive recommended the AAAP to the Council Assembly.  A proposal by a deputation to the Executive, that the wording of the the AAAP be changed to protect Burgess Park was accepted.  A proposal opposing high-rise tower blocks along the Albany Road and a proposal to delay AAAP for further data on carbon emissions were both rejected.  The Council accepted that carbon data did not include embodied carbon, but the Inspector considered that the figures were still reliable.  The Council considered that the environmental benefits of development outweighed the benefits of retaining the present buildings.  It was also argued that the extension to the Aylesbury of the proposed Multi Utility Services Company (MUSCo), which was to be part of the Elephant and Castle regeneration, would make development carbon negative).

Jan 2010 - The Council Assembly accepts Executives's AAAP recommendation.  AAAP is published. 

£456m of public money has been spent on the Aylesbury estate regeneration as the first of the new council homes are completed.[^1]

The cross subsidy it will receive from the sale of the private homes once phase one is completed amounts to just £8.7m

That's a cost of £608k per dwelling for the 750 homes demolished on the estate to date. 

This is a far cry from the Council's original forecasts, which said the scheme would be entirely funded by the profits of building a mix of private homes on the redeveloped estate. Southwark calculated that the cost to the Council would be 'broadly neutral'. Its [Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050927/Agenda/Item%2007%20-%20The%20AylesburyEstate%20Revised%20Strategy%20-%20Report.pdf) approving the redevelopment in 2005 said this:

It even produced a detailed [costing](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/annexc.pdf) showing a small deficit of around £7m for the whole scheme.

In the event costs have ballooned

Elsewhere on the estate the Council has just refurbished 80 homes at a cost just £10k per dwelling.

Southwark Council has always argued that it simply didn't have enough money to refurbish the estate..

## Too big to fail

Aylesbury estate was selected by Tony Blair for his \[first speech as prime minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blairs-pledge-to-the-dark-estates-1253883.html) on 2nd June 1997, where he made his 'forgotten people' speech, [saying](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0602/blair.shtml) there must be no more *"no-hope areas"* in new Labour's Britain.

*Blair visiting the Aylesbury in 1997 to give his first speech as prime minister*

Blair vowed to *'learn from the mistakes of the past'* and replace the dogma of bygone housing policies with pragmatism and common sense. The estate's regeneration was subsequently initiated as part of New Labour's '\[Urban Task Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towards_an_Urban_Renaissance)' inner-city renewal programme. The project was subsequently awarded £56m funding under the \['New Deal for Communities'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_for_Communities) partnership and regeneration plans were drawn up to transfer the estate to a housing association for redevelopment.

## Other boroughs take a different approach

Other London boroughs take a different approach to regeneration. Islington has an estate called the Six Acres estate near Finsbury Park. The Six Acres estate was built at the same time as Heygate & Aylesury, by the same contractors (Laing) using the [same system](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LBI_SixAcres_Jespersen12M.pdf) (Jespersen 12M). 

Instead of demolishing its estate and handing it over to the private sector at a loss, Islington Council chose to refurbish the Six Acres estate in 2012. The 473 homes on the estate were refurbished with [new external wall insulation](http://www.lawtechltd.co.uk/Project_Tollington.aspx), new entry doors, exterior furnishing improvements, [green roofs](http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf) and [cycle shelters](http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/green-roofed-cycle-shelters-for-islington/). 

More information about the Six Acres estate regeneration can be found [here](http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study_-_newsletter.pdf), [here](http://bit.ly/1ssLvV6), [here](http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf), [here](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/OCD28_SixAcresestateRefurb_Illustrations.pdf) and under planning application ref: P072153 on [Islington Council's Planning Portal](/img/6acrescasereport.pdf).

The London Borough of Wandsworth also has an estate made with the same construction system as the Aylesbury estate - the [Doddington & Rollo estate](/img/doddington.pdf) in Battersea. Wandsworth has no plans to demolish the estate.

**Footnotes:** 
[^1]: The first public funding spent on the scheme was the £56m from the government’s NDC (New Deal for Communities) programme.

The scheme was subsequently allocated 46m from the government’s Estate Regeneration Fund and £27m from GLA funding to date (see source [here](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s52526/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Update.pdf)), plus £13m of HCA funding, which helped build the completed phase 1a of the scheme (see source on page 20 of the [this document](https://35percent.org/img/Estate-Regen-Sourcebook-Web-Version.pdf)).

In addition, the Council has spent a considerable amount of its own HRA account funds on the scheme. This [Jan 2022 Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report%20Future%20of%20Aylesbury%20Estate.pdf) shows that £65.42m of HRA funds have been spent to date(para 18) and releases a further £29.8m for ongoing acquisitions of leaseholders (para 43).

This comes after the Council's [decision](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-07-09-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) in 2020 to spend £193m just in order to complete the first phase of the scheme alone, after its development partner said it wouldn't proceed on the agreed basis.

There is also the £35m cost to the Council of building the replacement library and health centre (see para 10 of [this Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s71667/Report%20Aylesbury%20Estate%20Community%20facilities%20at%20Plot%2018%20Delivery.pdf)). Note that Notting Hill Genesis is contributing £3m towards the cost of these so the overall cost to the Council is £32m.

Note also that Southwark will receive a Land payment from Notting Hill Genesis amounting to £5.7m.

Taking this into account a total of £456.5m of public funds has been spent just in order to complete the first of four phases of the estate's redevelopment.
