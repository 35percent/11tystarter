One of the first tasks of Southwark's [new planning committee](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgCommitteeMailingList.aspx?ID=119) will be to consider developer Lendlease's [controversial planning application for a new office block](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/lendlease-applies-for-office-block-and-zero-housing-in-next-stage-of-regeneration/) on the final plot of Elephant Park, H1.  Plot H1 stands on what was protected metropolitan open land, on the site of the demolished Heygate estate.

The H1 application, which includes a proposal for a health hub, is a dramatic change of direction by Lendlease.  Up to now, Elephant Park has been built as a housing development, with some retail, and other uses; Lendlease's original plan was for H1 to be much the same, with three residential blocks, one of of 30-storeys, two of ten-storeys, comprising about 300 homes, across 36,100sqm of floorspace (links).

This proposal was part of Lendlease's successful [2013 planning permission application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary).  Now, in 2022, Lendlease says it has built enough housing and an office block would improve 'employment capacity'.  A health hub, covering a tenth of the total floorspace, is also being offered, to sweeten the proposal - but only in place of an almost equal amount of affordable workspace that would otherwise have to be provided.

#### Southwark really likes Lendlease

Despite Southwark's council housing boss [declaring last year that building homes was a *'moral imperative'*](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/exclusive-council-housing-boss-hits-back-at-infilling-misinformation/), Southwark Council has reacted favourably  to Lendlease's proposal to dump housing, in favour of offices, with local councillors saying that they are 'generally in support' of the application, at a pre-election hustings.

More practically Southwark Council also changed the planning rules to give the application a fair wind.  We [reported last September](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2021-09-12-lendleases-final-plot-for-elephant-park-offices-not-homes/) how Southwark Council has smoothed Lendlease's path by changing the local planning rules in the [Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan), to allow a ten-fold increase in 'employment space' on Elephant Park.

Lendlease [2013 planning permission](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary) allowed only a maximum of 5,000sqm of business space across the whole Elephant Park site of thirteen plots.  Lendlease's [new application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage) proposes ten time that amount, 49,565sqm on a single plot.  This would have had no hope of being aproved without a change in the planning rules.  Southwark Council duly obliged and approved an 'uplifted' amount of 60,000sqm, when the new Southwark Plan was adopted in [February 2022](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan).

#### More homes in a smaller space....

Lendlease has also been careful to build all the homes it promised under its 2013 permission.  Lendlease say it has built almost to the maximum floorspace allowed by the permission, delivering 2,689 homes, including 25% affordable housing.

But these 2,689 homes must obviously have been shoehorned into fewer plots, at a greater density than originally proposed, if Lendlease now finds itself with a spare plot that can be used for an office development.  If this applicatiob succeeds it will be the second time that the density of the development has been increased.  In 2019 Lendlease [took advantage of a poorly drafted s106](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/) legal agreement, to increase the original maximum homes from 2,469 to 2,689 homes.

There is also a discrepancy between what Southwark has been told about the number of homes built and the figures Lendlease have given in their in their 2022 half-yearly report to the [Australian Securities Exchange](https://www.lendlease.com/au/investor-centre/announcements/) (ASX).  Lendlease's [hy22 Lendlease Major Urban Projects](<C:\Users\grego\Documents\D-Drive 201017\Copy of Elephant Amenity Network\Blog 35percent campaign\Netlify\HY22 Lendlease Major Urban Projects>) says that 3,208 homes will be delivered on Elephant Park (including Trafalgar Place), 284 more units than are in the [planning documents](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/3087518D1F1E382D8EC9CBF0F7834E63/pdf/21_AP_1819-PLANNING_STATEMENT-1145922.pdf).

Indeed, Lendlease has built over 3,000 homes - an increase of over 500 homes?
At least that's what it says in Lendlease's internal reports. Southwark says that only xxx homes have been built. WHO KNOWS?

Here's the original planning consent:

And what about the social rented homes. It turns out that the pitiful 92 social rented homes haven't even been provided at social rent, despite Southwark insisting that they have.

So Lendlease gets a double windfall of 500 plus extra homes AND a massive office block!

As usual Southwark has rolled over to accommodate Lendlease, even changing its planning policy to allow office workspace on the site. 

We want to see the Council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee investigate the entire redevelopment. Only then can we know exactly what has been built.
