One of the first tasks of Southwark's [new planning committee](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgCommitteeMailingList.aspx?ID=119) will be to consider developer Lendlease's [controversial planning application for a new office block](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/lendlease-applies-for-office-block-and-zero-housing-in-next-stage-of-regeneration/) on the final plot of Elephant Park, H1.







It is situated where Elephant Park used to stand - a green space (protected metropoliton open land) on the corner of Walworth Road and Elephant Road

Lendlease's currently approved plans for this phase comprise a thirty storey tower block surrounded by two 10-storey blocks, which provide 300 homes across 36,100sqm of floorspace.

Lendlease has now applied for a variation to the planning consent to build an office block on this site instead.

Office workspace instead of housing? Sounds reasonable maybe on the face of it?

But no - not instead, the housing has already been built. The 300 homes due to go up on this site have been shoehorned into the other plots in the scheme. 

Indeed, Lendlease has built over 3,000 homes - an increase of over 500 homes?
At least that's what it says in Lendlease's internal reports. Southwark says that only xxx homes have been built. WHO KNOWS?

Here's the original planning consent:

And what about the social rented homes. It turns out that the pitiful 92 social rented homes haven't even been provided at social rent, despite Southwark insisting that they have.

So Lendlease gets a double windfall of 500 plus extra homes AND a massive office block!

As usual Southwark has rolled over to accommodate Lendlease, even changing its planning policy to allow office workspace on the site. 

We want to see the Council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee investigate the entire redevelopment. Only then can we know exactly what has been built.
