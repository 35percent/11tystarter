One of the first tasks of Southwark's [new planning committee](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgCommitteeMailingList.aspx?ID=119) will be to consider developer Lendlease's [controversial planning application for a new office block](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/lendlease-applies-for-office-block-and-zero-housing-in-next-stage-of-regeneration/) on the final plot of Elephant Park, H1.  Plot H1 stands on what was protected metropolitan open land, on the site of the demolished Heygate estate.

The H1 application, which includes a proposal for a health hub, is a dramatic change of direction by Lendlease.  Up to now, Elephant Park has been built as a housing development, with some retail, and other uses; Lendlease's original plan was for H1 to be much the same, with three residential blocks, one of of 30-storeys, two of ten-storeys, comprising about 300 homes, across 36,100sqm of floorspace (links).

This proposal was part of Lendlease's successful [2013 planning permission application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary).  Now, in 2022, Lendlease says it has built enough housing and an office block would improve *'employment capacity'*.  A health hub, covering a tenth of the total floorspace, is also being offered, to sweeten the proposal - but only in place of an almost equal amount of affordable workspace that would otherwise have to be provided.

#### Southwark really likes Lendlease

Despite Southwark's council housing boss [declaring last year that building homes was a *'moral imperative'*](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/exclusive-council-housing-boss-hits-back-at-infilling-misinformation/), Southwark Council has reacted favourably  to Lendlease's proposal to drop housing, in favour of offices, with local councillors saying that they are *'generally in support'* of the application, at a pre-election hustings.

More practically Southwark Council also changed the planning rules to give the application a fair wind.  We [reported last September](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2021-09-12-lendleases-final-plot-for-elephant-park-offices-not-homes/) how Southwark Council has smoothed Lendlease's path by changing the local planning rules in the [Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan), to allow a ten-fold increase in *'employment space'* on Elephant Park.

Lendlease's [2013 planning permission](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV1JKBWR520&activeTab=summary) allowed only a maximum of 5,000sqm of business space across the whole Elephant Park site of thirteen plots.  Lendlease's [new application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage) proposes ten time that amount, 49,565sqm on a single plot.  This would have had no hope of being approved without a change in the planning rules.  Southwark Council duly obliged and approved an *'uplifted'* amount of 60,000sqm, when the new Southwark Plan was adopted in [February 2022](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan).

#### More homes in a smaller space....

Lendlease has also been careful to build all the homes it promised under its 2013 permission.  Lendlease say it has built almost to the maximum floorspace allowed by the permission, delivering 2,689 homes, including 25% affordable housing.

But these 2,689 homes must obviously have been shoehorned into fewer plots, at a greater density than originally proposed, if Lendlease now finds itself with a spare plot that can be used for an office development.  If this applicatiob succeeds it will be the second time that the density of the development has been increased.  In 2019 Lendlease [took advantage of a poorly drafted s106](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/) legal agreement, to increase the original maximum homes from 2,469 to 2,689 homes.

There is also a discrepancy between what Southwark has been told about the number of homes built and the figures Lendlease have given in their in their 2022 half-yearly report to the [Australian Securities Exchange](https://www.lendlease.com/au/investor-centre/announcements/) (ASX).  Lendlease's [hy22 Lendlease Major Urban Projects](<C:\Users\grego\Documents\D-Drive 201017\Copy of Elephant Amenity Network\Blog 35percent campaign\Netlify\HY22 Lendlease Major Urban Projects>) says that 3,208 homes will be delivered on Elephant Park (including Trafalgar Place), 284 more units than are in the [planning documents](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/3087518D1F1E382D8EC9CBF0F7834E63/pdf/21_AP_1819-PLANNING_STATEMENT-1145922.pdf).

#### .......fewer social rent

Lendlease remains silent on the shortfall of affordable housing, against the longstanding 35% affordable housing requirement, half of which should be social rented.  Roughly calculated this is a loss of about 400 affordable homes, most of which should be social rent.

There is also some doubt as to whether the 92 social rented units that have been delivered are being let to their tenants at social rents.  All the socia rented units are three-bed homes and are owned and managed by housing association L&Q.  At least one of these units is being let at a rent of £249pw, including service charge.  This comppares to the £145.65 gross pw given as the average three-bed social rent for housing associations by [Southwark's Key Housing Stats 2020](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/42459/Southwark-Key-Housing-Stats-2020.pdf).

#### The sweetener - the health hub

Lendlease appear to have won local councillors around to supporting their office block proposal by promising a health hub.  Much of the delay in determining the application, which should have been decided by Spetember 2021, is probably down to negotiations between Southwark Council, the NHS SE London Clinical Commissioning Group and Lendlease, and also including GP services provider Nexus.

 A health hub or facility would be very welcome and it has been a requirement for Lendlease to build it since 2013, under the current planning permission. Lendlease, though, appear to have opted to pay health contributions of £1.08m instead and now only wish to build it if they are relieved of providing a similar-sized amount of affordable workspace and if it comes attached to an office block, several times the size of the hub.

SCREENSHOT OF 2013 S106 RE HEALTH FACILITY

Given that Lendlease were happy to build the health hub as part of a residential development before, there is no reason why it must be part of an office development now, other than it suits Lendlease.  It is also not clear why councillors and Southwark think they are getting a good deal by supporting a health hub with offices, when there is already an agreement to build a health hub with homes.  We can only assume that they agree with Lendlease that there is enough housing already and the lose of affordable housing, and affordable workspace, is not a problem. (No new viability assessments)

#### Princess Street and Manor Place surgeries to go?

Despite all this, and before the planning application has been decided, Southwark Council has joined with Lendlease and the NHS SE London Clinical Commissioning Group to sign a [Memorandum of Understanding](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/3E107DB92E1C2C8D981676CADEFBDA2E/pdf/21_AP_1819-LETTER_FROM_LENDLEASE_ON_HEALTH_HUB_USE-3485797.pdf), supporting the provision of a health hub and an [indicative plan of the hub](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/A24210053190B15B0DA22B657CF282E3/pdf/21_AP_1819-PLOT_H1_HEALTH_HUB_TEST_FITS__INDICATIVE_-3443704.pdf) has been drafted.

A couple of points leap out - replaces PSt and Manor Place; only 30 year lease.[](<C:\Users\grego\Documents\D-Drive 201017\Copy of Elephant Amenity Network\Blog 35percent campaign\Netlify\HY22 Lendlease Major Urban Projects>)

Community space

Affordable retail

Overage

So Lendlease gets a double windfall of 500 plus extra homes AND a massive office block!

As usual Southwark has rolled over to accommodate Lendlease, even changing its planning policy to allow office workspace on the site. 

We want to see the Council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee investigate the entire redevelopment. Only then can we know exactly what has been built.
