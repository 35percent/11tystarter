Elephant Park developer Lendlease is watering down its commitments to providing a health hub as part of its proposed office block on the final plot of Elephant Park, H1.

A draft s106 agreement (link) between Lendlease and Southwark Council shows that Lendlease do not want to commit to a 30-year lease, if the development goes ahead, but leave the length of the lease open to negotiations.  The 30-year lease had previously been specified in both the council report to the planning committee (link) and a Memorandum of Understanding between Lendlease, Southwark and the NHS (link).

The draft agreement was lodged as part of the recent public inquiry, called after Lendlease appealed against the Council’s decision to reject their office block application in October 2022.  Southwark Council and local campaign group Community Objectors H1 (which includes the 35% Campaign) have submitted their own versions of the s106 agreement to the inquiry, which both specify that the health hub lease should be for 30 years.  Objectors had already unsuccessfully argued that even 30 years was too short a period.


The office block and health hub will only be built if Lendlease wins its appeal.  A decision will be made by the inquiry inspector and is still awaited.  The Inspector will also decide which version of the s106 will apply.

#### How big will the health hub be?

The size of any eventual health hub is also in doubt.  It would be provided instead of affordable workspace, which is what is usually required in developments of this kind, under Southwark’s planning rules.  These say that 10% of the total workspace should be ‘affordable’ at a 25% rent discount for 30 years (check).  There is a provision, though, for this to be for ‘health services’ in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and both Southwark and Lendlease prefer this as an option for H1.

However, Lendlease does not propose to simply provide the same floorspace for the health hub as it would have done for the affordable workspace.  Instead, it proposes a complicated formula where the health hub’s rent would be a determining factor in calculating its size.  This is to avoid paying more for providing the health hub than for providing affordable workspace, but it might also mean that the hub is smaller than 10% of the total workspace.

Southwark Council go along with this approach in their version of the draft s106 agreement. The Community Objectors H1 (COH1) disagree and in their version say the health hub simply says that the health hub should be 10% of the affordable workspace.

#### What we say….

Lendlease should provide a health hub that is equal to 10% of workspace at a minimum 30-year lease, if it gets planning permission for its office block.  That is the simple understanding of what it proposed in its planning application and that is what should be delivered.

Lendlease’s approach leaves both the length of the lease and the size of the health hub subject to the vagaries of negotiation, while strengthening their own hand.  The cost of the health hub would be effectively capped by whatever the cost of the affordable workspace would be (figures supplied by Lendlease).

It also appears that a high rent could be a limiting factor on the size of the health hub.  Lendlease must cover the cost of the rent discount and fit-out, to meet the affordable workspace requirement.  A sufficiently high rent and fitout costs, under a cap, leave the only other variable as the size of the hub, which could be smaller as a consequence.

Objectors to the application, including 35% Campaign, Southwark Law Centre, the Walworth Society and local residents, are all in favour of a health hub.  As COH1 they argued at the planning inquiry that it should come as part of a residential development on H1, not as part of a giant office block.  Neither should it be at the expense of affordable workspace, which should be used for the many local traders that local charity Latin Elephant identified as needing affordable premises in its planning inquiry evidence (link).  We must now wait to see whether the inspector agrees with any of these arguments us.

Meantime, we cannot understand why Southwark is conceding points in the s106 agreement that could result in a smaller health hub. Not for the first time, Southwark is bending to Lendlease’s will; they allowed Lendlease to squeeze more homes into a smaller space on Elephant Park and then agreed in principle to an office block on H1, only rejecting it on size grounds.  This all adds up to the lesson that developers like Lendlease repeatedly put their own interests first, but it is a lesson Southwark cannot learn.
