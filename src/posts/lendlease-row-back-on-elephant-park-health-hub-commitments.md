Elephant Park developer Lendlease is watering down its commitments to providing a health hub as part of its proposed office block on the final plot of Elephant Park, H1.
A draft s106 agreement (link) between Lendlease and Southwark Council shows that Lendlease do not want to commit to a 30-year lease, if the development goes ahead, but leave the length of the lease open to negotiations.  The 30-year lease had previously been specified in both the council report to the planning committee (link) and a Memorandum of Understanding between Lendlease, Southwark and the NHS (link).
The draft agreement was lodged as part of the recent public inquiry, called after Lendlease appealed against the Councilâ€™s decision to reject their office block application in October 2022.  Southwark Council and local campaign group Community Objectors H1 (which includes the 35% Campaign) have submitted their own versions of the s106 agreement to the inquiry, which both specify that the health hub lease should be for 30 years.
The office block and health hub will only be built if Lendlease wins its appeal.  A decision will be made by the inquiry inspector and is still awaited.  The Inspector will also decide which version of the s106 will apply.
