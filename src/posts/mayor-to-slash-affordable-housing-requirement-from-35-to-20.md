As has been [widely reported](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/23/ministers-confirm-plans-to-reduce-londons-affordable-housing-quotas), London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Secretary of State for Housing, Steve Reed have agreed to reduce the affordable housing requirements for private developments in London from 35% to 20%.  

Up until now, developers who provided 35% affordable housing could take a no-questions-asked 'fast-track' route for planning permission, which allowed them to avoid providing a viability assessment - this threshold is now being dropped to 20%.  [Our previous blogpost](https://www.35percent.org/posts/nearly-1-000-empty-homes-on-the-aylesbury-estate/) noted that this follows a lobbying campign by developers, with a main aim of achieving this reduction.  A [House Builders Federation report](https://www.hbf.co.uk/documents/14913/Mind_the_Gap_Examining_Londons_housing_shortfall.pdf) recommended that the requirement be reduced to 25%, the Financial Times and [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-affordable-homes-rule-gla-mayor-b1250874.html) said that developers were demanding an even bigger cut, to between 10-15%. 

Developers' obligation to pay the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) has also been cut in half, if developers commit to just 20% affordable housing, 60% of which should be social rent.  The CIL cut can be increased, if the affordable housing is increased.  [CIL pays for](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7969dc40f0b63d72fc59ba/1897278.pdf) *'a very broad range of facilities such as play areas, parks and green spaces, cultural and sports facilities.....and other community safety facilities'.*  Developers will also be able to claim £220,000 per unit for social rent, £70,000 for shared ownership and either £90,000 or £140,000 for intermediate rent units for about half of their affordable units, drawn from £322m of governement grant funding.

[Build to rent](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/build-to-rent) schemes will  be eligible for the same terms if they provide 30% of their homes at intermediate rent at [London Living Rent](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/housing-and-land/buying-and-owning-home/london-living-rent), with the remainder at *'a range of genuinely affordable rents'*.

Existing schemes, which already have planning permission will be able to apply for this grant too,

The proposals are outlined in a [joint paper from the Government and the Mayor](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68fa1ab730c331c88be6f00a/support-for-house-building-in-london.pdf).  Other proposals include design changes that  *'constrain density'* - reducing dual aspect dwellings, increasing the number of dwellings in each building core and reducing cycle storage. 

The Mayor will also be given greater powers to take decisions out of borough hands, if it looks as it might refuse an application of more than 50 units.  He will also be able to take the decision on developments of over 1,000sqm on Green Belt and Metropolitan Open land.  He will alos be able to grant planning permissions for 'strategic schemes'.

Six-week consultations are promised on these proposals.  

Aditya Chakrabortty in the Guardian [revealed how the proposals were all fashioned in behind-closed-doors](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/labour-housing-memo-leak-steve-reed) discussions with developers, sidelining councils and anyone from the wider community.

*'Berkeley has delivered £528.9 million of pre-tax profit for the year, with net cash at £337.3 million, in spite of ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic volatility.  With over 75% of sales secured for the coming year, we are well-placed to achieve our FY26 pre-tax profit guidance of £450 million'.* 

In Southwark both British Land and Berkeley Homes, the developers of Canada Water and the Aylesham Centre respectively are already seeking to reduce affordable housing to these levels.

What we think

One thing is clear - the decision-makers on what gets built in London are the big property developers; the Mayor and Secretory of State just follow their lead.

When SK came to power in 2017 he pledged his viability task force would 'My new viability officers are scrutinising viability assessments to ensure that these are consistent with my guidance and that affordable housing delivery is increased. They are supporting boroughs to take a robust approach to viability testing and are undertaking work to inform the new London Plan which will provide a new policy framework for London.'
