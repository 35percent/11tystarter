As has been [widely reported](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/23/ministers-confirm-plans-to-reduce-londons-affordable-housing-quotas), London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Secretary of State for Housing, Steve Reed have agreed to reduce the affordable housing requirements for private developments in London from 35% to 20%.  As noted in our previous blogpost this follows a lobbying campign by developers, with a main aim of achieving the reduction.  A [House Builders Federation report](https://www.hbf.co.uk/documents/14913/Mind_the_Gap_Examining_Londons_housing_shortfall.pdf) recommended that the requirement be reduced to 25%, the Financial Times and [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-affordable-homes-rule-gla-mayor-b1250874.html) said that developers were demanding an even bigger cut, to between 10-15%.

Developers' obligation to pay the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) has also been cut in half, when schemes commit to just 20% affordable housing, 60% of which should be social rent.  This cut can be increased, if the affordable housing is increased.  [CIL can pay for](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7969dc40f0b63d72fc59ba/1897278.pdf) *'a very broad range of facilities such as play areas, parks and green spaces, cultural and sports facilities.....and other community safety facilities'.*  Developers will also be able to claim £220,000 per unit for social rent, £70,000 for shared ownership and either £90,000 or £140,000 for intermediate rent units from £322m of grant funding. 

The proposals are outlined in a [joint paper from the Government and the Mayor](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68fa1ab730c331c88be6f00a/support-for-house-building-in-london.pdf).  Other proposals include design changes that  *'constrain density'* - reducing dual aspect dwellings, increasing the number of dwellings in each building core and reducing cycle storage. 

The Mayor will also be given greater powers to take decisions out of borough hands, if it looks as it might refuse an application of more than 50 units.  He will also be able to take the decision on developments of over 1,000sqm on Green Belt and Metropolitan Open land.  He will alos be able to grant planning permissions for 'strategic schemes'.

Six-week consultations are promised on these proposals.  

Aditya Chakrabortty in the Guardian [revealed how the proposals were all fashioned in behind-closed-doors](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/labour-housing-memo-leak-steve-reed) discussions with developers, sidelining councils and anyone from the wider community.



In Southwark both British Land and Berkeley Homes, the developers of Canada Water and the Aylesham Centre respectively are already seeking to reduce affordable housing to these levels.

And the developer's campaign looks like it is succeeding - a Guardian article by Aditya Chakraborttyreveals that the Steve Reed, the new government's new housing minister, is poised to reduce affordable housing requirements in London down to 20% and suspend CIL, the community infrastructure levy, which pays for the social infrastructure needed to support big new developments, such as new GP surgeries.
