As has been [widely reported](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/23/ministers-confirm-plans-to-reduce-londons-affordable-housing-quotas), London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Secretary of State for Housing, Steve Reed have agreed to reduce the affordable housing requirements for private developments in London from 35% to 20%.

As noted in our previous blogpost this follows a lobbying campign by developers, sparked by a House Builders Federation report, ne of the main aims was to reduce the amount of affordable housing developers have to provide, as a condition of getting planning permissions mounted a strong lobbying campaign to reduce the amount of affordable housing required from them under the Mayor's London Plan.

According to the BBC News the HBF has called for the 35% affordable housing requirement to be reduced to 25%, in a report on housing development in London. The Financial Times and Evening Standard add that developers are demanding an even bigger cut, to between 10-15%. In Southwark both British Land and Berkeley Homes, the developers of Canada Water and the Aylesham Centre respectively are already seeking to reduce affordable housing to these levels.

And the developer's campaign looks like it is succeeding - a Guardian article by Aditya Chakraborttyreveals that the Steve Reed, the new government's new housing minister, is poised to reduce affordable housing requirements in London down to 20% and suspend CIL, the community infrastructure levy, which pays for the social infrastructure needed to support big new developments, such as new GP surgeries.
