As has been [widely reported](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/23/ministers-confirm-plans-to-reduce-londons-affordable-housing-quotas), London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Secretary of State for Housing, Steve Reed have agreed to reduce the affordable housing requirements for private developments in London from 35% to 20%.  As noted in our previous blogpost this follows a lobbying campign by developers, with a main aim of achieving the reduction.  A [House Builders Federation report](https://www.hbf.co.uk/documents/14913/Mind_the_Gap_Examining_Londons_housing_shortfall.pdf) recommended that the requirement be reduced to 25%, the Financial Times and [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-affordable-homes-rule-gla-mayor-b1250874.html) said that developers were demanding an even bigger cut, to between 10-15%.

Developers' obligation to pay the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) has also been cut in half, when schemes commit to just 20% affordable housing, 60% of which should be social rent.  This cut can be increased, if the affordable housing is increased.  [CIL can pay for](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7969dc40f0b63d72fc59ba/1897278.pdf) *'a very broad range of facilities such as play areas, parks and green spaces, cultural and sports facilities, district heating schemes and police stations and other community safety facilities'.*



In Southwark both British Land and Berkeley Homes, the developers of Canada Water and the Aylesham Centre respectively are already seeking to reduce affordable housing to these levels.

And the developer's campaign looks like it is succeeding - a Guardian article by Aditya Chakraborttyreveals that the Steve Reed, the new government's new housing minister, is poised to reduce affordable housing requirements in London down to 20% and suspend CIL, the community infrastructure levy, which pays for the social infrastructure needed to support big new developments, such as new GP surgeries.
