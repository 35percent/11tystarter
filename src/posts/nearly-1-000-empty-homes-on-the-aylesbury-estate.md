A council document seen by the 35% Campaign numbers the **total of empty homes on the Aylesbury estate at 974.**  Fourty-eight homes are also listed as being squatted, but it is not clear whether these are in additon to the void homes.  In any event, the figures mean that over a third of the estate's original number of 2,700 homes, when it was built back in the 1970's.

The document is dated the 14 July 2025 and lists the number of voids for each phase of the estate's regeneration, which is now entering its twenty-seventh year [^1].

Phase 2B (Padbury, Ravenstone, Wendover, Winslow) has 372 voids; Phase 2C, 254 voids; Phase 3, 207 voids and Phase 4 141 voids.  The number of squatted propeties for each phase is also given and totals 48.
