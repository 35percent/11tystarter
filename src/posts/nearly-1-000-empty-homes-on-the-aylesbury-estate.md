A council document seen by the 35% Campaign numbers the **total of empty homes on the Aylesbury estate at 974.**  Fourty-eight homes are also listed as being squatted, but it is not clear whether these are in additon to the void homes.  In any event, the figures mean that over a third of the estate's original number of 2,700 homes, when it was built back in the 1970's.

The document is dated the 14 July 2025 and lists the number of voids for each phase of the estate's regeneration, which is now entering its twenty-seventh year [^1].  Phase 2C has 254 voids; Phase 3, 207 voids and Phase 4, 141 voids.

The highest number of voids though is for Phase 2B, the next scheduled for redevelopment.  The Phase 2B blocks (Padbury, Ravenstone, Wendover, Winslow) have 372 voids, almost the entire number of dwellings.  Southwark Council's planning committee [approved Notting Hill Genesis' proposals](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-phase-2b-approved-by-planning-committee-for-the-second-time/) for the phase back in June, earlier this year, but the s106 agreement that seals the approval has not yet been concluded. 

The total number of voids is an increase on the 713 figure of January 2024, with 600 vacant more than 2 years, as reported in [a recent Southwark News article](https://southwarknews.co.uk/news/news-plus/southwark-council-clamps-down-on-aylesbury-estate-squatting-in-response-to-residents-fears/).

#### Notting Hill Genesis fail to deliver

The same Southwark News article contains the claim by Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) that, as *'proud partners with Southwark*' they have *'so far delivered more than 700 new homes, of which 85% are affordable housing...'*, without making it clear that most of these are in fact both funded and provided by Southwark Council, through [a bail-out of the First  Development Site (FDS), in July 2020](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-07-09-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/).  Throught this deal the Council took over two of the three FDS plots (FDS A & B), at a cost of over Â£200m, leaving FDS C to NHG.  FDS C will provide just 56 social rent units, 75 shared-ownership and 190 private homes.  Leaving FDS C with NHG also denies Southwark important revenue for cross subsidising affordable and social rented housing. 

All-importantly, NHG has delivered very little affordable housing, particularly social rented housing. Despite holding an outline planning permission since 2015, and aside from the FDS, Notting Hill Genensis has only completed the [122 homes on Plot 18, of which just 23 are social rented.](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-regeneration-fails-to-deliver-affordable-and-family-housing/)

What we think - 'Delay, delay, delay'

According to his baseball cap, the Labour government's new Secretary of State for housing's motto is 'Build, baby, build', but as far as the Aylesbury is concerned it seems to be more case  of 'Delay, delay, delay'.  Notting Hill Genisis has held the outline planning permission for the remainder of the Aylesbury regeneration
