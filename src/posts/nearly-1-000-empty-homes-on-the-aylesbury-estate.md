A Southwark Council document seen by the 35% Campaign numbers the **total of empty homes on the Aylesbury estate at 974.**  Fourty-eight homes are also listed as being squatted, but it is not clear whether these are in additon to the void homes.  In either case, the figures mean that over a third of the estate's original number of 2,700 homes, when it was built back in the 1970's.

The document is dated the 14 July 2025 and lists the number of voids for each phase of the estate's regeneration, which is now entering its twenty-seventh year [^1].  Phase 2C has 254 voids; Phase 3, 207 voids and Phase 4, 141 voids.

The highest number of voids though is for Phase 2B, the next scheduled for redevelopment.  The Phase 2B blocks (Padbury, Ravenstone, Wendover, Winslow) have 372 voids, almost the entire number of dwellings.  Southwark Council's planning committee [approved Notting Hill Genesis' proposals](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-phase-2b-approved-by-planning-committee-for-the-second-time/) for the phase back in June, earlier this year, but the s106 agreement that seals the approval has not yet been concluded. 

The total number of voids is an increase on the 713 figure of January 2024, with 600 vacant more than 2 years, as reported in [a recent Southwark News article](https://southwarknews.co.uk/news/news-plus/southwark-council-clamps-down-on-aylesbury-estate-squatting-in-response-to-residents-fears/).

#### Notting Hill Genesis fail to deliver

The same Southwark News article contains the claim by Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) that, as *'proud partners with Southwark*' they have *'so far delivered more than 700 new homes, of which 85% are affordable housing...'*, without making it clear that most of these are in fact both funded and provided by Southwark Council, through [a bail-out of the First  Development Site (FDS), in July 2020](https://www.35percent.org/posts/2020-07-09-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/).  Throught this deal the Council took over two of the three FDS plots (FDS A & B), at a cost of over Â£200m, leaving FDS C to Notting Hill.  FDS C will provide just 56 social rent units, 75 shared-ownership and 190 private homes.  Leaving FDS C with NHG also denies Southwark important revenue for cross subsidising affordable and social rented housing. 

All-importantly, NHG has delivered very little affordable housing, particularly social rented housing. Despite holding an outline planning permission since 2015, and aside from the FDS, Notting Hill Genesis has only completed the [122 homes on Plot 18, and just 23 of these are social rented.](https://www.35percent.org/posts/aylesbury-regeneration-fails-to-deliver-affordable-and-family-housing/)

The table below gives a full account of the social rent delivery of the regeneration so far, according to planning documents.  It should be noted that while these show Southwark Council providing 301 social rented homes it has pledged that all 581 units of FDS A and B will be council homes.

#### What we think - 'Delay, baby, delay'

According to Steve Reed's baseball cap, the motto of the Labour government's new Secretary of State for Housing's is 'Build, baby, build', but as far as Notting Hill Genesis and the Aylesbury are concerned it seems to be more case  of 'Delay, baby  delay'.  On top of its poor affordable housing delivery since 2015, NHG also embroiled itself in a misconcieved attempt to build outside its planning permission.  And despite losing the resulting High Court case, it is pressing on with this approach for Phase 2B.  NHG have presented no concrete plans for Phase 3 and 4, the remaining two phases.

Meantime the very large number of current Aylesbury residents, estimated to be 1,300 in the [Southwark News report](https://southwarknews.co.uk/news/news-plus/southwark-council-clamps-down-on-aylesbury-estate-squatting-in-response-to-residents-fears/), including new residents and those in temporary accommodation, are left in limbo on a *'near-derelict estate'*

In short, in terms of social rented housing, cost to the borough and living conditions on the Aylesbury,  NHG's *'proud'* partnership with Southwark Council is doing more harm than good; the Council should start taking steps to end it, as part of a serious reconsideration of the whole Aylesbury regeneration.
