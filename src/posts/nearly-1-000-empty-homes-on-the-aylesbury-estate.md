A council document seen by the 35% Campaign numbers the total of empty homes on the Aylesbury estate at 974.  This is over a third of the estate's original number of homes, when it was built back in the 1970's.

The document is dated the 14 July 2025 and lists the number of voids for each phase of the estate's regeneration, which is now entering its twenty-seventh year [^1].
