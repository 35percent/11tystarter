The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has rejected a complaint by a member of the 35% Campaign that Southwark Council has no effective monitoring system for the delivery of affordable housing through private housing developments.  The judgement (LINK) comes after an 18 month enquiry process, with the Ombudsman ruling that *'based on the evidence seen so far, there was no fault because the Council does have an effective methods for carrying out its functions'*.

However, the Ombudsman declined to consider descrepancies between 'live' website affordable housing figures and those found on other reports, from Southwark Council and the Greater London Authority (GLA).  This evidence showed that over 3,500 social  rented units and over 200 completed schemes were unaudited.  The Ombudsman did not take this into account because *'it was not directly connected to the original complaint'.*

### The two complaints

This was the second complaint on this issue to the Ombudsman.  After an earlier complaint (LINK) in 2016 Southwark had undertook to introduce effective monitoring procedures, including annual audits and an online monitoring tool, able to record 'live data'.  In the six years since then, though, only two incomplete annual audits had been published and the monitoring tool was never launched.

Southwark said in response to the complaint that new 'off the peg' software was better than the commissioned tool (the dxw tool) and that, in any event it was working with another software developer for something better.  The four year gap between the first audit in 2017 and the second in 2022 was explained by the sheer amount of data that has to be processed.  Most of this task had been undertaken by two officers (later increased to ten to complete the project).  

Southwark explained that the various kinds of affordable housing complicated the enforcement of the legal s106 agreeemts that should guarantee the housing.  It cited one legal case, where homes had been returned after a significant failure to comply with the s106 (LINK), but said otherwise *'most breaches'* were *'easily..resolved'*. 

### The Ombudsman's decision

The Ombudsman noted in his decision that there was a *'gap of several years between issuing annual reports'* and it is only in the last year that the council had *'substantially completed its database'*.  Nonetheless he concuded that this did not amount to a fault, because the task *'was always likely to take a long time'*.   No time period had been set for this when the first complaint was considered in 2016.  The Ombudsman decided that the council was also not at fault for replacing the dxw tool with proprietary software, because this was a matter for them to decide.

The Ombudsman therefore concluded *'I am satisfied that the Council now has effective means to capture and record AHO \[Affordable Housing Data] for enforcement and other purposes'.*

### What we think....the unconsidered evidence

The Ombudsman's decision is a disappointment to us and a generous decision as far as Southwark is concerned, given what the Ombudsman's own report tells us.  While it says that Southwark **\*'now** has effective means'* of monitoring affordable housing delivery, (our emphasis) this is six years after the issue came to light.  It is also not clear that the means are really effective, despite the Ombudsman's decision.  A bespoke tool that could have monitored delivery in real-time has been discarded and another, not specifically designed for the task, is being used instead, with the possibility of reverting to a purpose built tool later.  

The report also says that the database of schemes has only been *'substantially'* completed in the last year.  This appears to be confirmed by the 3,556 unit gap between the number of units of social housing [Southwark says it has delivered](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=4) since 2004/05 - 5,597 - and the number of [social rented units built since 2002 actually audited](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODIzNTdiMGUtMDAxNS00NGI1LThjY2EtYjBjMWQwYzcxMzQ2IiwidCI6ImNhZjg2Y2IxLThjYTItNDU0NS1hNGRkLWYzNTlkMDM5MGEwOCJ9&pageName=ReportSection) - 2,041.  

The Greater London Authority (GLA) also has reponsibility for monitoring the delivery of affordable housing (much of which it funds) across London, including Southwark.  Our examination of the GLA database (LINK) found 209 completed schemes listed as having provided affordable housing as part of a planning permission, which do not appear in Southwark's audit.  

One-hundred and forty one of these schemes can be found on [Southwark's planning portal](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-applications/planning-register-search-view-and-comment-on-planning-applications) and date from at least 2004 onwards.  Many are simple one and two unit conversions, but there are also much larger schemes, including parts of Elephant Park,  Canada Water with thirty-eight schemes for between ten and 100 units.

### ....weak enforcement actions

The Ombudsman's report devotes a section to enforcing s106 obligations which has a couple of alarming explanations from Southwark's officers, about how affordable housing is secured and retained.  The first is that *'there were cases where there had been changes between what was originally expected during the planning (sic) and what was finally agreed in section 106 agreements. **It was sometimes difficult to know what changes had occurred....'*** (our emphasis).

This is wrong and should not be happening.  There should be no *'change between what was originally expected during planning'* and *'what was was finally agreed in s106 agreements'* and it is the business of Southwark's planning officers to make sure that there is no change.  When there are changes Southwark's officers should be able to say why there have been changes and ensure that they are only be made through the proper processes.

Most major residential planning applications (over 10 units) are decided by a planning committee of elected councillors, who will approve a scheme that provides a precise amount of affordable housing of given tenures. If the developer cannot deliver what has been agreed at committee, then a s106 agreeement for something different should not be signed; it is not for officers and developers to agree something other than was approved by committee. 

The report does not say how often this has occurred, but goes on  to relate an explanation from Southwark's officers that 'evolving policy' or loss of funding may be reasons for changes, between committee and legal agreement .  Again, this should not be happening; applications are judged against 'emerging' policy', where relevant, and changes to funding, or the viability of an agreed scheme should be addressed by way of formal variations.  Officers note that some applications change through such variations, but only on *'other occassions'*.

### ....social rent or affordable rent?

The report also says that *'In some cases, the type of AHO tenancy was not what had been required'.*  The report does not say  how often this has occurred, but one instance that has come to light is that of Gutenberg Court, a development recommended by officers and duly approved by the Bermondsey Community Council in 2011.  The recommendation included social rent.  This became Intermediate rent in the s106 and ...captured by the audit after an enquiry from SLC....anymore Gutenberg Courts?

[Gutenberg Ct s106](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/a_request_for_section_106_agreem?nocache=incoming-1899025#incoming-1899025)

Again, the report does not say how often this has occcured, but that *'most breaches related to tenure type issues and had either been resolved or could easily be resolved'*.

They paint a picture of a haphazard process, where significant changes are being made to approved applications for different reasons and at different point in the planning process, which Southwark officers cannot explain, because a propoer monitoring process is not in place.  The significance of these exchanges does not appear to have been registered by the Ombudsman.  

### High social rents

No urgency, except the spur of answering the complaint.
