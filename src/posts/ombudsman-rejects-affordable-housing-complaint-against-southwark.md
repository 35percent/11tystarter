The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has rejected a complaint by a member of the 35% Campaign that Southwark Council has no effective monitoring system for the delivery of affordable housing through private housing developments.  The judgement (LINK) comes after an 18 month enquiry process, with the Ombudsman ruling that *'based on the evidence seen so far, there was no fault because the Council does have an effective methods for carrying out its functions'*.

However the Ombudsman declined to consider descrepancies between 'live' website affordable housing figures and those found on other reports, from Southwark Council and the Greater London Authority (GLA).  This evidence showed that over 3,500 social  rented units and over 200 completed schemes were unaudited.  The Ombudsman did not take this into account because *'it was not directly connected to the original complaint'.*

### The complaints

This was the second complaint on this issue to the Ombudsman.  After an earlier complaint in 2016 Southwark undertook to produce effective procedures, including an annual audit, to check delivery of affordable housing, under the legal s106 agreements struck with developers for affordable housing.  The second complaint was that Southwark had failed to do this.
