The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has rejected a complaint by a member of the 35% Campaign that Southwark Council has no effective monitoring system for the delivery of affordable housing through private housing developments.  The judgement (LINK) comes after an 18 month enquiry process, with the Ombudsman ruling that *'based on the evidence seen so far, there was no fault because the Council does have an effective methods for carrying out its functions'*.

However the Ombudsman declined to consider descrepancies between 'live' website affordable housing figures and those found on other reports, from Southwark Council and the Greater London Authority (GLA).  This evidence showed that over 3,500 social  rented units and over 200 completed schemes were unaudited.  The Ombudsman did not take this into account because *'it was not directly connected to the original complaint'.*

### The two complaints

This was the second complaint on this issue to the Ombudsman.  After an earlier complaint (LINK) in 2016 Southwark had undertook to introduce effective monitoring procedures, including annual audits and an online monitoring tool , able to record 'live data'.  In the six years since then, though, only two incomplete annual audits had been published and the monitoring tool had not been launched.

Southwark said in response to the complaint that new 'off the peg' software was better than the commissioned tool (the dxw tool) and that, in any event it was working with another software developer for something better.  The four year gap between the first audit in 2017 and the second in 2022 was explained by the sheer amount of data that has to be processed.  Most of this task had been undertaken by two officers (later increased to ten to complete the project).  

Southwark explained that the various kinds of affordable housing complicated the enforcement of the legal s106 agreeemts that should guarantee the housing.  It cited one legal case, where homes had been returned after a significant failure to comply with the s106 (LINK), but said otherwise *'most breaches'* were *'easily..resolved'*. 

### The Ombudsman's decision

The Ombudsman noted in his decision that there was a *'gap of several years between issuing annual reports'* and it is only in the last year that the council had *'substantially completed its database'*.Nonetheless he concuded that this did not amount to a fault, because the task *'was always likely to take a long time'*.   No time period had been set for this when the first complaint was considered in 2016.  The council was also not at fault for replacing the dxw tool with proprietary software - this was a matter for the council to decide.

The Ombudsman therefore concluded *'I am satisfied that the Council now has effective means to capture and record AHO \[Affordable Housing Data] for enforcement and other purposes'.*

### What we think - the unconsidered evidence

The Ombudsman's decision is a disappointment to us and a generous decision as far as Southwark is concerned, given what the Ombudsman's own report tells us.  While it says that Southwark ***'now** has effective means'* of monitoring affordable housing delivery, (our emphasis) this is six years after the issue came to light.  It is also not clear that the means are really effective, despite Ombudsman's decision.  A bespoke tool that could have monitored delivery real-time has been discarded and another, not specifically designed for the task is being used instead, with the possibility of reverting to a purpose built tool later.  

The report also says that the database of schemes has only been *'substantially'* completed in the last year.  This appears to be confirmed by the gap between the with the number of units of social housing [Southwark says it has delivered](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=4) sinnce 2004/05 - 5,597 - and the number of social rented units audited our own examination of the database, which shows

No urgency, except the spur of answering the complaint.
