The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has rejected a complaint by a member of the 35% Campaign that Southwark Council has no effective monitoring system for the delivery of affordable housing through private housing developments.  The judgement comes after an 18 month enquiry process, with the Ombudsman ruling that *'based on the evidence seen so far, there was no fault because the Council does have an effective methods for carrying out its functions'*.
