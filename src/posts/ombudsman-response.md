# Response to Ombudsman investigation
Southwark's 30 May 2022 response to the Ombudsman's enquiries, shows that seven years on from our original complaint, it still doesn't have effective compliance monitoring procedures in place.

The Ombudsman's 2016 [decision](https://www.35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf) required those procedures to include - an AUDIT and then ANNUAL COMPLIANCE CHECKS. 

It said the Council would do an audit of all the affordable S106 homes provided in the borough and then conduct annual compliance checks to ensure that they remained provided under the required tenure.

Whilst it has made some tardy and half-hearted steps in conducting an audit (we examine these further below), it's response to the Ombudsman shows that it still has no process whatsoever to check compliance. The Council still relies entirely upon trust to ensure that developers and housing associations are complying with section 106 requirements. This was a key criticism of the previous Ombudsman's decision (para 19).

Finally, the Council claims that enforcement action is currently being undertaken relating to 62 schemes. 

We note that all of these enforcement actions have been inititated in the last six months since we referred our complaint to the Ombudsman (link to portal). 

There is no information available explaining exactly what enforcement action is being taken, in each case it simply states 'under investigation'. 

In the absence of further information, it is our view this is simply an attempt to appease the Ombudsman by giving the impression that the Council is taking action.

We examine enforcement matters in more detail below and show that enforcement action has still not been taken on any of the schemes we reported to the Council in our original complaint seven years ago.

## The problems with the latest (March 2022) audit
The audit has identifed just 2041 social rented homes:

![Screenshot of the Council's latest audit](2041.png)

This is a shortfall of over 3,000 social rented homes against those delivered according to the Council's own figures. The Council's own [published data](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?&article) says that 5597 social rented homes were completed in the borough between 2005/5 and 2019/20. [This Committee report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s84622/Report%20New%20Council%20Homes%20Rooftop%20Development%20Principles.pdf) confirms that 355 of these would have been direct delivery Council homes (see para 28). This leaves 5,242 homes approved as social rent and delivered since 2004/5, of which only 2041 have been identified in the Council's latest audit. 

The GLA database shows 209 schemes completed since 2004, which don't appear in the Council's audit of 188 schemes. This suggests that the Council is not even half way to completing its first audit, despite having had seven years to do so. 

Also, the Council's audit contains at least a dozen schemes where the RSL return doesn't match the section 106 requirement but no red traffic light appears and no enforcement action is being taken:

* 08/AP/2411 - overprovision but not red traffic light
* 15/AP/1062 - overprovision but no red traffic light
* 04/AP/1235 - Committee report says 20 affordable homes but audit says requirement of only 7
* 03/AP/0641 - Planning Committee report promised 15 SR homes but audit says none required.
* 09/AP/0717 - Permission was for 12 SR but both audit and RSL return say 13
* 08/AP/3078 - RSL return shows shortfall of social rented units but traffic light green
* 17/AP/0296 - The developer has failed to provide any of the affordable homes whatsoever. Enforcement action was initiated on 10 May 2022 but if fails to cover the scheme's failure to implement a viability review (a condition of the s106)

::: important
JERRY - THIS IS AS FAR AS I GOT WITH this. Plenty more if you want to sift through futher.
:::

Red traffic light but no enforcement action has been initiated:
02/AP/2012

Here - go through all the schemes individually showing inconsistencies - i.e. aylesbury phase 1a and our own examples that Georgie has flagged up - i.e. Gutenberg Court.

The audit consists in asking RSLs how many homes they have provided in each scheme under a given tenure. It is not concerned with other important requirements of the section 106 conditions - i.e. the unit mix (whether they were provided as 1-bed flats or as 5-bed family homes) or 

Finally, it still relies upon trust - i.e. it relies upon developers/housing associations to be truthful in their responses to what tenure has been provided.

## The DXW tool
We note that the Council's latest audit uses [Microsoft PowerBi visualization software](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) - not the DXW tool.

I note that the Council has been careful not to provide a clear answer to the Ombudsman's question of whether it is using the DXW tool.

In its response R8 to the Ombudsman, the Council implies that it is indeed using the DXW monitoring tool and has been doing so since April 2022.

I have strong concerns that this is not the case and suggest the Ombudsman requests to see a copy of the Service Level Agreement with DXW to confirm whether this is the case. Note that the DXW tool is a web application hosted by DXW. It is effectively a web site connected to a database. As can be seen from the Alpha Report, The DXW tool would have had a public interface showing scheme level data.
If the DXW tool is in operation then the Council should be able to provide the URL to this public interface.

Last year I made an [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/748870/response/1849828/attach/3/210805%202021%20January%20JR%20to%20SB%20Redacted%20FOI%202560592%20Redacted.pdf) asking why the DXW monitoring tool hadn't been put into use and asking for a copy of communications about the tool.
The Council's response showed an email from its section 106 Manager to its Head of Planning, requesting that the DXW tool be put into use:

> "Five years on, we are still not monitoring AH, as promised...This delay has now been picked up by the 35% campaign. This service still has not been used by the planning department.Five years on, we are still not monitoring AH, as promised. This delay has now been picked up by the 35% campaign, councillors and the housing scrutiny committee."

He continues:
> "Further delay is likely to result in increased interest from the 35% campaign and the media (local news and journals such as Inside Housing), and most likely a second complaint to the ombudsman (we would be in no position to justify the five year delay and I understand that a repeat offence carries a harsher penalty)."

We note that the [final report](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/11530/alpha-report.pdf) from the development presentation of the DXW tool in Dec 2019 laid out the fundamental underlying problem that the tool was going to solve:

![](https://35percent.github.io/tenure-checker/img/ahscreenshot.png)

Without the tool, there is no evidence that Southwark has solved this fundamental problem of being able to link addresses with section 106 agreements.

## Enforcement actions (and lack therof)
List examples of original complaint schemes and show how they are still being advertised at market rent.

::: warning
Maybe add a screenshot of Gutenberg court advert on Homesearch? Jerry have you got a copy I can't seem to find mine? Maybe Georgie has a copy?
:::

Gutenberg Court is good because it was one of the schemes in our original complaint.

Add other examples from Georgie and Jerry's Elephant Park example.

## Remedy
Following the Ombudsman's previous decision in 2016, which directed the Council to introduce procedures for affordable housing delivery, we expected this to occur in the same manner as when it introduces other new procedures, which is where a detailed policy document is drawn up and then brought before the Council's Cabinet or other committee for approval. This has not happened.

We were expecting Southwark Council to draw up a policy document setting out its annual compliance checks, much similar to the GLA's procedures which it uses for schemes that are allocted grant funding:
https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/12_gla_cfg_section_9._compliance_audit_-_july_2021.pdf

Every year, the GLA's annual compliance audit selects a random set of schemes to be audited by an independent auditor, who then selects a random set of homes from each scheme for which he requests to see a copy of the tenancy agreements from the respective Housing Association. He then writes up a report confirming whether or not the homes are being provided at the rent levels required by the tenure conditions of planning consent.

We expected this audit to be overseen by a committee - probably the planning committee and that we expected it to set out details of exactly enforcement action would involve when a breach in section 106 agreements is found.

We also expected Southwark's procedures to include the requirement to liaise with its Housing Department to ensure that on completion, social rented homes are allocated to families on the borough's housing waiting list - as per the current policy requirement.

We also expected a system to ensure that in-lieu payments were requested and processed in line with the requirements section 106 agreements where relevant.

In seeking remedy for our complaint, we request three actions:
1. Southwark draws up a detailed procedural policy for compliance monitoring, which includes the points raised above.
2. The draft policy is referred to the Ombudsman for his approval before his final decision is drawn up.
3. That policy is then referred to the Council's planning committee for approval.
