Council hoardings publicising the Council's delivery of 11,000 council homes are a familiar sight around Southwark.  They promote the Council's creditable council house building programme, which it launched in 2013 and describes as the *'most ambitious...in the country'.*

The reality is different.  Only one in ten new homes built in Southwark since 2004 is social rented.  The figure has emerged from the London Mayor's new Planning Datahub, which documents all the homes built in London since 2004, including those built in Southwark.  The Datahub shows that after demolitions are taken into account, only 2,676 out of twenty-five thousand new homes in Southwark are social rented.

##### Eighteen years of low social rent, but high free-market numbers

The contrast between the small number of social rent and the large number of free-market homes built is stark, as our chart below shows.  The Datahub figure show that nearly 70% of all new homes are free-market (nearly 18,000 in number) against just 10.7% social rent, with the rest made up of other affordable homes.

##### Lost Heygate homes

The Datahub also shows that more social rented homes were demolished in 2021 than were built.  Only 31 were built, while 122 were demolished, with a net loss of 91 homes.  Southwark claim this is a 'discrepancy' but the lost units can be identified through the Datahub as being from the demolished Heygate estate.
