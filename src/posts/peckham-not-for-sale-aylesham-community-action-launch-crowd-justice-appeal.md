Peckham campaign group Aylesham Community Action has announced **September 9** as the the launch of a CrowdJustice appeal \[LINK] in its continuing battle against Berkeley Homes.  The appeal is for funds to support a legal team at a forthcoming public inquiry.  Berkeley Homes' proposal for a giant development at the heart of Peckham that would provide only 50 social rented homes, out of nearly 900 in total, was resoundingly rejected by Southwark Council's planning committee in July \[LINK].  Berkeley are now taking the case to an appeal before a government inspector, due to begin at the end of October.
