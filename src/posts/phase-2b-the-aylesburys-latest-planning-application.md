##### Density doubled, but social housing halved

After years of delay Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) has submitted its detailed [planning application 22/AP/2226](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/) for Phase 2B, the next phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment.  This phase takes in 241-471 Wendover and the Ravenstone and Padbury blocks, all of which are just across the road from Burgess Park.

As [Southwark News](https://southwarknews.co.uk/featured/latest-aylesbury-estate-development-would-slash-social-rent-homes-by-50-per-cent/) and our good friends at [Southwark News](https://twitter.com/SouthwarkNotes/status/1557081532313092098) have pointed out, NHG's proposal will halve the number of social rented homes, despite doubling the total housing density.  There are 373 homes on site at the moment, of which 327 are social rented.  NHG want to replace those with 369 private homes, 82 affordable homes and 163 social rent, a total of 614 homes.

There are a couple of measures of how much social and affordable housing should be provided on the Aylesbury regeneration.  NHG's proposed schemes meets one of these, but fails another.  There will be 50% affordable housing, and 77% will be social rented (PS 7.19), when measured by habitable rooms and this is in line with the new [Southwark Plan 2022](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/94325/Southwark-Plan-2022.pdf).  But the NHG should also be providing at least as much social rented floorspace as is being lost (19,985.3sqm), so that Aylesbury tenants are able to return to the redeveloped estate (*'facilitate a right of return for existing tenants').* This means there should be 19,985.3sqm of social rent*,* whereas only 19, 113.4sqm, proposed, contrary to the Mayor's London Plan (LP H8; PS 7.43).

But NHG are receiving Â£28m from the Mayor for the scheme and for that money it should be providing 60% social rented housing, according to the Mayor's London Plan (PS 7.7).
