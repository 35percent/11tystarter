##### Density doubled, but social housing halved

After years of delay Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) has submitted its detailed [planning application 22/AP/2226](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/) for Phase 2B, the next phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment.  This phase takes in 241-471 Wendover and the Ravenstone and Padbury blocks, all of which are just across the road from Burgess Park.

As [Southwark News](https://southwarknews.co.uk/featured/latest-aylesbury-estate-development-would-slash-social-rent-homes-by-50-per-cent/) and our good friends at [Southwark News](https://twitter.com/SouthwarkNotes/status/1557081532313092098) have pointed out, NHG's proposal will halve the number of social rented homes, despite doubling the total housing density.  There are 373 homes on site at the moment, of which 327 are social rented.  NHG want to replace those with 369 private homes, 82 affordable homes and 163 social rent, a total of 614 homes.

There are a several measures of how much social and affordable housing should be provided on the Aylesbury regeneration.  NHG's proposed schemes meets one of these, but fails others.  There will be 50% affordable housing, and 77% will be social rented (PS 7.19), when measured by habitable rooms and this is in line with the new [Southwark Plan 2022](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/94325/Southwark-Plan-2022.pdf).  But, as NHG themselves note in their planning documents (link) that the Mayor's London Plan requires that '*Affordable housing that is replacing social rent housing must be provided as social rent housing where it is facilitating a right of return for existing tenants'.*  NHG should therefore be providing at least as much social rented floorspace as is being lost, 19,985.3sqm, whereas they only propose 19,113.4sqm, contrary to the London Plan (LP H8; PS 7.43).

##### Compare and contrast

NHG tries to get around their London Plan failure by making a different comparison, between what they now propose and the what would have built under the outline planning permission (OPP) they already hold.  The OPP would have delivered 183 social rented units.  While this new standalone application would have fewer units (163), NHG are quick to point out that there will nonetheless be an increase of 4,557.4sqm in social rent floorspace (with a gain of 20 habitable rooms) because there will be more 3+ bed units. This is true, but it also a false comparison.  NHG are abandoning the OPP for the whole of the regeneration, not just Phase 2B, and so relieving themselves of the obligation of replacing 2,249 social rented homes, under the new Southwark Plan requirements (PS 6.9); the extra social rent floorspace on Phase 2B, with a loss of units and only a small gain of habitable rooms to boot, hardly compensates for this.

##### Mayor funds the loss of social housing

NHG is also receiving a £28m grant from the Mayor for the scheme, though it is hard to see how this can be justified.  The Mayor's [funding guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/301120_homes_for_londoners_-_funding_guidance-acc1.pdf) for estate regeneration says;

*'Funding will not be available for units that replace homes that have been, or will be, demolished. Where homes have become obsolete the GLA will consider funding these replacement homes in exceptional circumstances, and only as part of a scheme that will increase the number of homes overall'.*

While the overall number of homes is doubling, the loss of social housing within that number means that £28m of public funds is going towards a scheme that replaces only half of the current social housing, while increasing the number of free-market units from from forty-six leaseholder properties to 369 private homes.

##### Notting Hill Genesis's swansong

The Phase 2B detailed application is NHG's third, after that for the First Development Site (FDS) and Plot 18 which were approved in 20XX.  NHG handed these (?) back to Southwark Council in 2019?, charging Southwark £XXX, alloing them to build zzz council homes, but retaining the money-generating free market home for themselves.
