# Executive Summary
Housing associations are charging up to 80% market rent for homes approved as social rent and Southwark Council is turning a blind eye. They are also allocating these homes to whoever they please and not families on Southwark's housing waiting list as per the policy requirement.

In other cases housing associations have been found selling affordable housing on the open market in 'sham transactions' and in some cases developers have simply failed to provide any of the affordable housing that it had agreed to when their planning applications were approved. 

Despite being aware of this problem since 2016 and despite a growing number of families (16,000) on its housing waiting list in desperate housing need, Southwark Council still doesn't have effective monitoring and enforcement procedures. This report concludes with suggestions that would improve oversight of the council's procedures and we are seeking the backing of Councillors    
 
# How it all started
In 2016, Southwark Council rejected our [complaint](https://35percent.org/img/ccomplaint15Dec2016.pdf) that affordable homes secured from private developments weren't in fact being delivered, Southwark's Director of Planning [responded](https://35percent.org/img/Stage1response28Jan2016.pdf) _â€˜Southwark Council has appropriate safeguards in place and has not failed in its duties .. therefore your compliant is not upheld"._

We made the complaint after discovering that Neo Bankside, a high-profile development next to the Tate Gallery, had only delivered 62 of the 94 social rented homes required by the planning approval. The story was [taken up by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/21/neo-bankside-how-richard-rogers-new-non-dom-accom-cut-out-the-poor).

## Signal Tower - affordable homes sold in 'sham transactions'
As a result of the Guardian article, we were contacted by a resident living at the Signal Tower, a new development at Elephant & Castle, who was confused about an affordable housing tenant pack put through his letterbox. He was concerned that a similar trick had been pulled by the developer of his building, as he was paying market rent for his flat. He asked if we knew how to find out if his flat was supposed to be one of the 11 affordable homes in the building and what implications that would have.

We told him that we had no way of knowing whether his home was one of the 11 affordable units and advised him to contact the Council.

It later [emerged](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/the-court-battles-over-section-106-delivery--56141) that the housing association concerned had sold these and other affordable homes across the borough on the open market, resulting in a court case, brought by Southwark Council in which Southwark claimed that the homes had been sold in 'sham transactions'.

## Further investigation
Given these examples of where there appeared to be no control over affordable housing delivery, we checked the Council's [choice-based letting system](https://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk/) for families on its housing waiting list and found homes approved as social rent being let at more market-related rents.

We then cross-checked planning committee reports with section 106 agreements, Land Registry information, the [GLA affordable housing outturn dataset](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) and the government's [CORE lettings data](https://core.communities.gov.uk/). From this we compiled a long (but by no means exhaustive) [list](https://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) of 46 schemes which indicated that there had been a potential breach in provision, involving a total of 1,145 social rented homes. We submitted these to the Council as evidence that it was not getting the affordable housing it should be and asked them to investigate. The evidence we submitted showed that homes which should have been social rent were being delivered instead at 'affordable rent' of up to 80% market rent.

## The 2016 Ombudsman investigation 
When Southwark rejected our complaint we referred the matter to the Local Government Ombudsman and in November 2016 he [published a damning report](https://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) stating that Southwark actually have no procedures whatsoever for monitoring the delivery of affordable housing.

The Council agreed to introduce compliance monitoring procedures and conduct an audit of all the section 106 affordable housing in the borough, followed by annual compliance checks.

# Half-hearted audit
In early 2022, after six years without having published any audit despite repeated requests, we referred our complaint back to the Ombudsman. Shortly after the Ombudsman agreed to investigate the Council published an audit. But the audit was barely half complete, it had identified only 2,041 of the 5,597 social rented homes and only 188 of the 397 marked as completed in its own records.

![](https://www.35percent.org/img/2041.png)

The Council's own [published data](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?&article) says that 5597 social rented homes were completed in the borough between 2005/5 and 2019/20. 

The GLA's planning database shows 209 schemes completed since 2004 (see appendix 1), which don't appear in the Council's audit of 188 schemes. So the Council is not even half way to completing its first audit, despite having had seven years to do so. 

There are also a significant number of inconsistencies in those schemes which have been audited.

For example, social rented homes on the redeveloped Heygate estate and both completed phases of the Aylesbury estate are listed as having been provided as affordable rent (i.e. up to 80% market rent). There is no information about the precise rent levels or whether these homes were allocated to returning residents or families on the housing waiting list.

Similarly, some of the 'early housing sites' where housing associations were given council land in return for a promise to provide a given number of social rented homes for displaced Heygate residents are also listed as having providing affordable rented homes instead.

* 03/AP/0641 - Planning Committee report promised 15 SR homes but audit says none required.
* 09/AP/0717 - Permission was for 12 SR but both audit and RSL return say 13
* 08/AP/3078 - RSL return shows shortfall of social rented units but traffic light green
* 17/AP/0296 - The developer has failed to provide any of the affordable homes whatsoever. Enforcement action was initiated on 10 May 2022 but if fails to cover the scheme's failure to implement a viability review (a condition of the s106)

The audit consisted simply of writing to the housing associations and asking them what they had delivered across its schemes in the borough. NHG on The Silwood estate says that of the 98? homes it built, it has provided 22 at 'keyworker social rents'. Without asking what the rent levels are or whether the homes were allocated to families on Southwark's housing waiting list, Southwark has ticked off the scheme as compliant.
  

Finally, it still relies upon trust - i.e. it relies upon developers/housing associations to be truthful in their responses to what tenure has been provided.

## Enforcement actions (and lack thereof)
List examples of original complaint schemes and show how they are still being advertised at market rent.


Maybe add a screenshot of Gutenberg court advert on Homesearch? Jerry have you got a copy I can't seem to find mine? Maybe Georgie has a copy?


Gutenberg Court is good because it was one of the schemes in our original complaint.

Add other examples from Georgie and Jerry's Elephant Park example.

Elephant & Castle shopping centre scheme where the planning committee was told that 'sum of money sufficient..' and then developer Delancey changed its mind. The draft s106 against the final s106.  

## Reccommendations
Following the Ombudsman's previous decision in 2016, which directed the Council to introduce procedures for affordable housing delivery, we expected this to occur in the same manner as when it introduces other new procedures, which is where a detailed policy document is drawn up and then brought before the Council's Cabinet for approval. This has not happened.

We suggest that a policy document is drawn up setting out the Council's procedures for monitoring and enforcement of affordable housing section 106 conditions. This should include:

1. An annual monitoring report listing all of the schemes completed to date with section 106 agreements for on-site affordable housing provision.
2. An accompanying schedule showing when and how each scheme was monitored.
3. A final schedule of schemes where breaches in provision have been found and description of what enforcement action has been or is being taken.4. A separate schedule showing how the homes listed above have been allocated to the council's housing waiting list.

As part of the process, we expect an annual compliance check, much similar to the GLA's procedures which it uses for schemes that are allocated grant funding:
[https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/12_gla_cfg_section_9._compliance_audit_-_july_2021.pdf](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/12_gla_cfg_section_9._compliance_audit_-_july_2021.pdf)

Every year, the GLA's annual compliance audit selects a random set of schemes to be audited by an independent auditor, who then selects a random set of homes from each scheme for which he requests to see a copy of the tenancy agreements from the respective Housing Association. He then writes up a report confirming whether or not the homes are being provided at the rent levels required by the tenure conditions of planning consent.

The annual monitoring report and accompanying schedules will then be presented to the Council's planning committee in open session to ensure transparency and public accountability.
