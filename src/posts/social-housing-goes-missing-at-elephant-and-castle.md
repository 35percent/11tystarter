[Land Registry records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=garland+court&postcode=se17+1lh&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=wansey&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction) for the first of the [Heygate estate rehousing sites](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/1692), Garland Court, appear to show that some of its  social housing is now on the open market.  Sixteen out of the Court's thirty-one flats should be social rented, but twenty-two flats appear to the land registry as 'leasehold', leaving just nine to meet the social rent requirement.   

[Garland Court was a show-piece development](https://aplust.net/blog/_drmm_wansey_street_housing_london/) built to accommodate at least some of the residents forced to leave their Heygate homes.  It was built in 2006 in advance of sixteen promised ['early housing sites'](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf) , which were  to re-house all the Heygate's displaced residents.  It was designed by much-admired architects dRMM and sits alongside what was the Walworth Town Hall, in Wansey St.

Garland's Court is on what was formerly a Southwark Council car park .  Southwark's Executive approved the land's sale to the housing association, [Southern Housing Group](https://www.shgroup.org.uk/), in Dec 2004, on the understanding that sixteen of the new homes would be social rented; three more would be shared ownership, while the remaining twelve would be free-market.  The Executive commitee report said;

*'31 residential units (comprising 19 units of affordable housing of which 16 units are for general needs rented housing and three units of intermediate tenure (shared ownership) housing and 12 units of private housing for sale)'*

*'The Council will be entitled to 100% of initial nominations to the general needs rented social housing units....The social housing units comprise 6 x 1 bed, 4 x 2 bed and 6 x 3 bed'.*

The price paid for the land is reserved to a closed report, but Land Registry documents show it passed at nil cost to the Southern Housing Group (CHECK).

Southwark's planning committee then [approved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=119&MeetingId=305&DF=08%2f02%2f2005&Ver=2) the thirty-one unit development, with 19 affordable homes, in Feb 2005.

### Seven lost social rent units?

Despite these requirements, though, the Land Registry records that 22 flats were subject to sales between 2006 and 2019 - ten more than the number of free-market homes allowed and seven more than the number of freemarket and shared-ownership homes.  There were twenty-five transactions in all, totalling £6,049,241, with three flats having two transactions each.  Twelve units were sold on the same day, 31 Mar 2008, for £2,475,616.[](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C4C68BF0DB749386891C71EF16D3798/pdf/04_AP_2114-DECISION_NOTICE-2287730.pdf)

These obligations are secured by contractual agreements, known as s106 agreements, between Southwark and developers.  Southwark undertook to conduct annual audits after an adverse 2016 Local Government Ombudsman decision, which concluded that nothing was in place to guarantee s106 compliance.  The LGO subsequently gave Southwark's monitoring a clean bill of health in 2022.

### What we think

Southwark Council sold a small piece of public land to a housing association at no cost, on the clear understanding that the newly developed site would deliver 16 social rented homes.  Land registry information shows that this cannot have been done - if 22 of the units of the thirty-one built have been sold, only seven can possibly be social rent.

Southwark has conducted three audits since 2016, but Garland Court has not appeared in any of them (CHECK).  and while it is not the biggest of developments the fact that it has been missed does not inspire much confidence in the audits' accuracy.

if any incentive were needed to ensure that the social rented housing was delivered, then that should have been provided by the fact that Garland Court was also the first of the so-called 'early housing sites', designed to re-house Heygate estate residents who had already lost their homes.

We have provided the information behind this blogpost to Southwark Council and it is now up to them to take whatever action is needed to restore the full number of social rented homes to Garland Court.

Southwark's Statement of Case for the CPO inquiry in February 2013 said that Wansey Street was one of the sites for rehousing displaced Heygate residents including council tenants:
