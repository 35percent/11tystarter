Garland Court was a show-piece development built to accommodate at least some of the residents forced to leave their Heygate homes.  Sixteen more ['early housing sites'](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf)  were promised for  a distinctive orange building on Wansey next to what was the Walworth Town Hall (image).  It was designed by much-admired architects, dRMM and built in 2006

31 flats approved, of which 16 social rent, 3 shared ownership and 12 private sale.
However, [LR records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=garland+court&postcode=se17+1lh&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=wansey&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction) show that 22 flats in Garland Court have come up as having been sold.
That's 7 more homes sold privately than there should be..
I think we might be onto something here, especially given that it was council land given at nil cost to the housing association to provide replacement homes for Heygate tenants.
Also the housing association (Southern Housing) is now Optivo - one of our baddies!
