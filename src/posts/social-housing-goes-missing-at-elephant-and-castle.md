[Land Registry records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=garland+court&postcode=se17+1lh&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=wansey&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction) for the first of the [Heygate estate rehousing sites](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/1692), Garland Court, appear to show that some of its  social housing is now on the open market.  Sixteen out of the Court's thirty-one flats should be social rented, but twenty-two flats appear to the land registry as 'leasehold', leaving just nine to meet the social rent requirement.   

[Garland Court was a show-piece development](https://aplust.net/blog/_drmm_wansey_street_housing_london/) built to accommodate at least some of the residents forced to leave their Heygate homes.  It was built in 2006 in advance of sixteen promised ['early housing sites'](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf) , which were  to re-house all the Heygate's displaced residents.  It was designed by much-admired architects dRMM and sits alongside what was the Walworth Town Hall, in Wansey St.

The development land was a Southwark Council car park .  Southwark's Executive approved the land's sale to the housing association, [Southern Housing Group](https://www.shgroup.org.uk/), in Dec 2004, on the understanding that sixteen of the new homes would be social rented; three more would be shared ownership, while the remaining twelve would be free-market.  The Executive commitee report said;

*'31 residential units (comprising 19 units of affordable housing of which 16 units are for general needs rented housing and three units of intermediate tenure (shared ownership) housing and 12 units of private housing for sale)'*

*'The Council will be entitled to 100% of initial nominations to the general needs rented social housing units....The social housing units comprise 6 x 1 bed, 4 x 2 bed and 6 x 3 bed'.*

The price paid for the land is reserved to a closed report, but Land Registry documents show it passed at nil cost to the Southern Housing Group (CHECK).

Southwark's planning committee then [approved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=119&MeetingId=305&DF=08%2f02%2f2005&Ver=2) the thirty-one unit development, with 19 affordable homes, in Feb 2005.

### Seven lost social rent units?

Despite these requirements, though, the Land Registry records that 22 flats were subject to sales between 2006 and 2019 - ten more than the number of free-market homes allowed and seven more than the number of freemarket and shared-ownership homes.  There were twenty-five transactions in all, totalling £6,049,241, with three flats having two transactions each.  Twelve units were sold on the same day, 31 Mar 2008, for £2,475,616.[](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0C4C68BF0DB749386891C71EF16D3798/pdf/04_AP_2114-DECISION_NOTICE-2287730.pdf)

These obligations are secured by contractual agreements, known as s106 agreements, between Southwark and developers.  Southwark undertook to conduct annual audits after an adverse 2016 Local Government Ombudsman decision, which concluded that nothing was in place to guarantee s106 compliance.  The LGO gave Southwark's monitoring a clean bill of health in 2022.

31 flats approved, of which 16 social rent, 3 shared ownership and 12 private sale.
However, [LR records](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/search?et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Afreehold&et%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aleasehold&limit=100&nb%5B%5D=true&nb%5B%5D=false&paon=garland+court&postcode=se17+1lh&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Adetached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Asemi-detached&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aterraced&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3Aflat-maisonette&ptype%5B%5D=lrcommon%3AotherPropertyType&street=wansey&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AstandardPricePaidTransaction&tc%5B%5D=ppd%3AadditionalPricePaidTransaction) show that 22 flats in Garland Court have come up as having been sold.
That's 7 more homes sold privately than there should be..
I think we might be onto something here, especially given that it was council land given at nil cost to the housing association to provide replacement homes for Heygate tenants.
Also the housing association (Southern Housing) is now Optivo - one of our baddies!
