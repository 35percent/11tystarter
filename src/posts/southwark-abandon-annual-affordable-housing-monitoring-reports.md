Southwark Council has abandoned the annual reviews of affordable housing monitoring that they promised to conduct in response to a critical Ombudsman’s report in 2016.  (LINK back to blogpost)


Only two audits have been conducted since that date in 2016 and 2022. This contrary to what is stated on Southwark’s [Housing delivery](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title) webpage, which says that they have conducted annually since 2016.

The development of a proper online tool that could replace the need for monitoring (cost £xxx) was also abandoned. 


Since then a second Ombudsman’s report has given Southwark a clean bill of health.


In response to inquiries by the Southwark Law Centre , Southwark claim that the are no longer needed because they now have [a webpage](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzJhYTg1ZDYtNzcxZC00MDQzLThlMDUtNTkyNDk2MTBkMzkyIiwidCI6ImY3YWRjZjA2LTk1OGYtNDRjNC1iYzFjLTMzOWVkZDkwOTAzZCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=591e92e31d05964600da) that does the job.

#### Southwark’s Housing delivery webpages

Southwark Council’s [Housing delivery ](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title)webpage has the [‘latest registered provider survey results’](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzJhYTg1ZDYtNzcxZC00MDQzLThlMDUtNTkyNDk2MTBkMzkyIiwidCI6ImY3YWRjZjA2LTk1OGYtNDRjNC1iYzFjLTMzOWVkZDkwOTAzZCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=591e92e31d05964600da) which have replaced the annual audit.  The survey results are displayed using tables, a pie chart and an interactive map. 

Clicking on the pie chart brings up a table of the developments of one of the registered providers who provide affordable housing in Southwark. A further click on one of the listed developments brings up a circle on the interactive map. Hover over the circle and a label giving the postcode and number of homes in the development appears; right click on the label and then on the ‘Show data point as a table’ option leads to a table giving the development’s details. 

#### Taking a closer look 

Superficially it all looks good, but on closer examination it becomes clear that the ‘survey results’ do not tell us what we need to know, which is whether or not we are getting the affordable housing we should be getting - the whole purpose of an audit.

Starting on the landing page, one problem is immediately apparent; the figures for the three categories of affordable housing (social rent, intermediate, affordable) do not add up to the total number of homes.  They total 20,374, while the figure for ‘Homes’ is given as 23,546 – a difference of over 3,000 homes .^1


Moving onto individual providers and taking Southern Housing as an example, we can see that the same problem is repeated; the total number of homes provided is given as 3,580, whereas the total for the three categories is 2,995 – a difference of 585 homes.

Clicking at random one of Southern’s schemes, 03/AP/1044, shows a similar problem; the figures only add up to 54 when the total is 80.  Checking the data table shows that the remaining thirteen homes are let at London Affordable Rents, an intermediate rent, but this does not appear in the figures displayed.

The s106 agreement for the development tells us that the scheme was originally to have 31 affordable homes, out of 82 total units, so it appears there has been a welcome increase of 49 affordable housing units that has not been captured. ^2

#### What should we be getting?

A further problem is that the figures for what has been delivered do not match the figures for what should be delivered.  What should be delivered is determined by the legal s106 agreements that developers sign with the councils and appear on page 2 of the webpages. ^3

Again, none of the figures remotely add up.  The data provided by the registered provider (RP) shows that 23,546 have been provided, whereas the number of homes that the s106 agreements say should be provided is 14,592 – a difference of 8,954 homes.

The figures for the five categories of affordable housing show similar large differences (for affordable rent, total affordable homes, intermediate homes, social rented homes and other affordable homes).  The difference for social housing is particularly striking; the RP provided data shows that they have provided 14,239 social rented homes, while the s106 agreements only require that they provide 1,833 – a difference of 12,406 homes, which if it is to be believed means that 

^1   These were the figures on the 22 Mar 2025; they may have since been varied.

^2   The s106, dated 9 Jan 2006, can be found via Southwark’s planning register, using ref 03/AP/1044 in the search box.  It is also noteworthy that while Southerb Housing are letting units at London Affordable Rent, LAR is specifically excluded from the list of acceptable intermediate housing in the Southwark Plan 2022 and did not exist as an affordable housing category on 2009).
