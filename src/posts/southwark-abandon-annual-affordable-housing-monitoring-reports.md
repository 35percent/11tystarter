Southwark Council appear to have abandoned the annual reviews of affordable housing monitoring that they promised to conduct in response to a critical Ombudsman’s report in 2016.  (LINK back to blogpost)

Only two audits have been conducted since that date in 2016 and 2022. This contrary to what is stated on Southwark’s [Housing delivery](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title) webpage, which says that they have conducted annually since 2016.

The development of a proper online tool that could replace the need for monitoring (cost £xxx) was also abandoned. 

Since then a [second Ombudsman’s report](https://www.lgo.org.uk/decisions/planning/other/21-009-646) has given Southwark a clean bill of health.

In response to inquiries by the Southwark Law Centre , Southwark claim that the are no longer needed because they now have [a webpage](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzJhYTg1ZDYtNzcxZC00MDQzLThlMDUtNTkyNDk2MTBkMzkyIiwidCI6ImY3YWRjZjA2LTk1OGYtNDRjNC1iYzFjLTMzOWVkZDkwOTAzZCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=591e92e31d05964600da) that does the job.

#### Southwark’s Housing delivery webpages

Southwark Council’s [Housing delivery ](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title)webpage has the [‘latest registered provider survey results’](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzJhYTg1ZDYtNzcxZC00MDQzLThlMDUtNTkyNDk2MTBkMzkyIiwidCI6ImY3YWRjZjA2LTk1OGYtNDRjNC1iYzFjLTMzOWVkZDkwOTAzZCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=591e92e31d05964600da) which have replaced the annual audit.  The survey results are displayed using tables, a pie chart and an interactive map. 

Clicking on the pie chart brings of registered providers brings up a table of their affordable housing developments. A further click on one of the listed developments brings up a circle on the interactive map. Hover over the circle and a label giving the postcode and number of homes in the development appears; right click on the label and then on the ‘Show data point as a table’ option leads to a table giving the development’s details. 

#### Taking a closer look

Superficially it all looks good, but on closer examination it becomes clear that the ‘survey results’ do not tell us what we need to know, which is whether or not we are getting the affordable housing we should be getting - the whole purpose of an audit.

Starting on the landing page, one problem is immediately apparent; the figures for the three categories of affordable housing (social rent, intermediate, affordable) do not add up to the total number of homes.  They total 20,374, while the figure for ‘Homes’ is given as 23,546 – a difference of over 3,000 homes .^1

Moving onto individual providers and taking Southern Housing as an example, we can see that the same problem is repeated; the total number of homes provided is given as 3,580, whereas the total for the three categories is 2,995 – a difference of 585 homes.

![](img/monitorin_audit_webpages_southern_housing_22032025_15_22_54.png "Southen Housing's returns")

Clicking at random one of Southern’s schemes, 03/AP/1044, shows a similar problem; the figures only add up to 54 when the total is 80.  

Checking the data table shows that the missing 26 units are shared-ownership and that the thirteen ‘Affordable’ homes are let at London Affordable Rents; this does not appear in the figures displayed.  London Affordable Rent is specifically excluded from the list of acceptable intermediate housing in the Southwark Plan 2022 and did not exist as an affordable housing category in 2006, the date of the s106 agreement which secured the affordable housing.

The s106 agreement for the development tells us that the scheme was originally to have 31 affordable homes, out of 82 total units, so, notwithstanding the LAR units, it appears there has been a welcome increase of 49 affordable housing units, but that has not been captured. ^2

#### Looking further - another provider

Checking out another big registered provider, London & Quadrant (L&Q), also throws up some confusing data.   A click on the pie chart, opening L&Q developments shows that while their total number of homes is 4,001, the combined total of social rent, intermediate and affordable only amounts to 3,454 - a difference of 547 homes. 

![](img/monitoring_audit_webpage_l-q_25_03_2025-10_20_06_250325.png "L&Q's returns")

L&Q is the affordable housing provider for the completed phases of the Aylesbury regeneration, Site 7, East St and Phase 1a, Albany Rd.  A click on application ref 12/AP/2332 shows five entries for Phase 1a, with total number of bedrooms for each entry. A further click on the first entry, (totalling 47 bedrooms) shows 24 homes, 20 'Intermediate', 0 for 'Affordable' and a '(Blank)'  for 'Social Rented'. 

![](img/monitoring_audit_l-q_aylesbury_12ap2332_first_entry_-25_03_2025-11_37_05.png "L&Q return for 12/AP/2332, first entry")

A right click brings up a data table option.  The table shows all twenty four flats listed as 'social rent', but also shows twenty of them as 'intermediate' (a different twenty flats are shown in a third column as 'leasehold').  The four flats omitted from the 'leaseholder' list have monthly rents, rounded to the pound, of £712 (flat 7), £641 (flat 9), £235 (flat 8) and £748 (flat 11).  The service is the same for each flat, £426, rounded to the pound.  

This gives rents, inclusive of service charge of of £1,138; £1,066; £661 and £1,174.  However the audit does not give any data on how many bedrooms each individual flat has, so it is impossible to tell whether or not these are proper social rents (add note about what is a social rent and council rent figures) (note - Click on < 1 of 3  > at bottom of webpage, to change pages).

Moving onto page 2 of the entry, brings up the s106 data held- this shows a series of blanks, which presumably means nothing is held. This page also shows a different number of total units, 23 homes, not  twenty-four, and 19 intermediate, not twenty.

![](img/monitoring_audit_l-q_aylesbury_12ap332_first_entry_s106_25_03_2025-11_49_19.png "S106 data for 12/AP/2332, first entry")

In short, while we can search the data and surmise that there are four social rent units, this is not confirmed by the audit, which leaves the figure for 'Social Rented' blank, has no figures for bedroom size, and contradictory information about both the total number of units and the number of intermediate units.

Further than this, there are no entries for the s106 affordable housing data, so Southwark appears not to hold any information against which it can ensure that the correct amount of affordable housing has been delivered.  This also means that Southwark does not have the means of enforcing delivery should it wish to - without the s106 agreement Southwark would have little or no evidence for a legal claim. 

#### The figures don't add up

The second page of the audit also shows that it is not just figure for isolated developments that don't add up - neither do the total figures for what are getting against what we should be getting.  What should be delivered is determined by the legal s106 agreements that developers sign with the councils.  The s106 data provided by the registered provider (RP) shows that 23,546 have been provided, whereas the number of homes that the s106 agreements say should be provided is 14,592 – a difference of 8,954 homes. ^3

The figures for the five categories of affordable housing show similar large differences (for affordable rent, total affordable homes, intermediate homes, social rented homes and other affordable homes).  The difference for social housing is particularly striking; the RP provided data shows that they have provided 14,239 social rented homes, while the s106 agreements only require that they provide 1,833 – a difference of 12,406 homes.

![](img/monitoring_audit_webpages_pg_2_22032025_16_22_49.png "Total homes provided measured against number promised by s106 agreements")

#### What we think

It is very difficult to make sense of what Southwark claim is their audit of the amount of affordable housing that RPs are providing to the borough, as explained on their [Housing delivery page](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title).  While we can see how much affordable housing may have been provided, we cannot see immediately wether or not it always matches what has been promised.  Our blog details just two examples which show that there are cases where it does not. (^4 Note of other examples?)

Southwark say that the purpose of the audit is *'To find out how many affordable homes are in Southwark (excluding our own)'.*  This is important information and the necessary baseline for any audit,

But Southwark also wants to ensure that registered providers deliver promised affordable housing, saying * 'Affordable housing is monitored to make sure it is built and managed as we agreed with developers and housing associations'.*  This cannot be done if Southwark allows the figures for delivery simply to accumulate, on a rolling basis, without any attempt to reconcile them againgst what has been agreed. 

Southwark refers to *'an audit period'* and says *‘Results are published as soon as a response is received......and the data has been validated....This means the results will update throughout the audit period’,* but does not say what the audit period is; nor does it provide any explanation of, for example, the huge difference between the social rent s106 figure and the much bigger registered provider figure.

It may be that the registered providers have provided data for their entire social rent stock, but if that is the case Southwark cannot say for certain that it includes new s106 homes; these would need to be filterred out and there is no indication that this has been done.

An accurate audit also depends upon receiving accurate information from the registered providers, and having an up to date s106 agreement against which to measure this.  Our L&Q example shows that rent infomation is incomplete (see also [this blogpost](https://www.35percent.org/posts/southwarks-new-developments-that-fail-to-deliver-social-rent/)) and that necessary s106 information is absent; without this kind of information Southwark is simply trusting in the reliability of the registered providers.

Southwark say that *‘The annual audit starts in March and covers the previous financial year’*, but the data published on the website obviously does not come from the single year and can only be the cumulative numbers of many years – Southwark do not say what those years are.  the validation is also questionable in the light of our examples in this and previous blogs

Southwark also say *‘Results are published as soon as a response is received from a registered provider and the data has been validated by council officers. This means the results will update throughout the audit period’*.  Assuming the audit period began in March 2024, are we seeing the returns for Mar 2024 to Mar 2025?  Again, Southwark does not say.  If, on the other hand, Southwark are continuing to get returns and simply adding data as it is received, it just turns the ‘audit’ into a data dump.

Further, the validation is obviously hopeless – none of the figures match and apart from the occasional note there is no evidence any action has been taken to explain obvious discrepancies ; Southwark is ultimately simply trusting that the information it is receiving is accurate.

One explanation for these discrepancies is that the RPs are returning data on their entire housing stock in the borough, not just that covered by the s106 agreements they have with Southwark.  if this is the case it renders the exercise useless as a way of ensuring that RPs are providing the homes that they should be on new developments.  We also cannot discount the possibility that some of the returns are untruthful.

Southwark’s own record of s106 information is also incomplete – previous blog

Whatever the explanation, Southwark should not just rest on the Ombudsman’s decision ‘in our favour’ to deflect any criticism of the audit, when it is so clearly not achieving its purpose.  The [second Ombudman’s decision](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ombudsman-rejects-affordable-housing-complaint-against-southwark/) was only concerned with the processs of the audit, not the outcomes. It is also worth noting that Southwark gave the Ombudsman an undertaking that there would be an annual audit, which it only partial fulfilled and is now abandoning, leaving us further from a proper audit process than we were in 2016.
