Southwark Council has abandoned the annual reviews of affordable housing monitoring that they promised to conduct in response to a critical Ombudsman’s report in 2016.  (LINK back to blogpost)


Only two audits have been conducted since that date in 2016 and 2022. This contrary to what is stated on Southwark’s [Housing delivery](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title) webpage, which says that they have conducted annually since 2016.

The development of a proper online tool that could replace the need for monitoring (cost £xxx) was also abandoned. 


Since then a second Ombudsman’s report has given Southwark a clean bill of health.


In response to inquiries by the Southwark Law Centre , Southwark claim that the are no longer needed because they now have [a webpage](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzJhYTg1ZDYtNzcxZC00MDQzLThlMDUtNTkyNDk2MTBkMzkyIiwidCI6ImY3YWRjZjA2LTk1OGYtNDRjNC1iYzFjLTMzOWVkZDkwOTAzZCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=591e92e31d05964600da) that does the job.

#### Southwark’s Housing delivery webpages

Southwark Council’s [Housing delivery ](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title)webpage has the [‘latest registered provider survey results’](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzJhYTg1ZDYtNzcxZC00MDQzLThlMDUtNTkyNDk2MTBkMzkyIiwidCI6ImY3YWRjZjA2LTk1OGYtNDRjNC1iYzFjLTMzOWVkZDkwOTAzZCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=591e92e31d05964600da) which have replaced the annual audit.  The survey results are displayed using tables, a pie chart and an interactive map. 

Clicking on the pie chart brings up a table of the developments of one of the registered providers who provide affordable housing in Southwark. A further click on one of the listed developments brings up a circle on the interactive map. Hover over the circle and a label giving the postcode and number of homes in the development appears; right click on the label and then on the ‘Show data point as a table’ option leads to a table giving the development’s details. 

#### Taking a closer look 

Superficially it all looks good, but on closer examination it becomes clear that the ‘survey results’ do not tell us what we need to know, which is whether or not we are getting the affordable housing we should be getting - the whole purpose of an audit.
