Southwark Council has abandoned the annual reviews of affordable housing monitoring that they promised to conduct in response to a critical Ombudsman’s report in 2016.  (LINK back to blogpost)
Only two audits have been conducted since that date in 2016 and 2022. This contrary to what is stated on Southwark’s Housing delivery webpage, which says that they have conducted annually since 2016.
