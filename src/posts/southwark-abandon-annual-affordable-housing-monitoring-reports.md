Southwark Council has abandoned the annual reviews of affordable housing monitoring that they promised to conduct in response to a critical Ombudsman’s report in 2016.  (LINK back to blogpost)
Only two audits have been conducted since that date in 2016 and 2022. This contrary to what is stated on Southwark’s [Housing delivery](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-environment-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy-and-guidance/monitoring-1/amount#lgd-guides__title) webpage, which says that they have conducted annually since 2016.
