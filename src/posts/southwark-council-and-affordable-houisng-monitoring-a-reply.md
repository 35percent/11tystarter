Southwark Council have issued a self-congratulatory message, ['Southwark Council takes action on affordable housing promies'](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2022/dec/southwark-council-takes-action-on-affordable-homes-promises#:~:text=21%20December%202022,fulfil%20their%20affordable%20housing%20commitments.) detailing its efforts to monitor the proper delivery of affordable housing, secured from new housing developments in the borough.

This follows two decisions from the local government ombudsman on complaints that there was no proper monitoring system in place.  The [first decision](https://www.35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf), in 2016, upheld the complaint; [ the second](https://www.lgo.org.uk/decisions/planning/other/21-009-646), in 2022, decided that enough had been  done to rememdy the situation and that Southwark now had an effective monitoring process.  The complaints were made by member of the 35% Campaign and we have blogged several times on the issue, [most recently after the second decision.](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ombudsman-rejects-affordable-housing-complaint-against-southwark/)

Southwark says that it provides *'the most comprehensive set of data...in a very transparent online way'*, in advance of any borough in the country and that *'the council's planning enforcement team investigate'*, if information is missing or not supplied.

Southwark also make a couple of more surprising claims.  They say that they agreed *'wholeheartedly, with the complainant'*, who pointed out that there was no proper monitoring and that it was *'not acceptable for landlords and developers to deprove people in the borough of the housing they need'.*  This was not apparant back in 2015.  Southwark rejected the complaint, twice, before it was referred to the Ombudsman and only acknowledged that there was a monitoring problem under the pressure of his decision.

Southwark also claim that there has actually been more affordable housing built in the borough than was required from developers, through the legal s106 agreements that were a condition of planning consents.  A quote from The responsible cabinet member is quoted, saying that while 6,2for climate emergency and susta



This should ring alarm bells, particularly given that it completely at odds with what Southwark says elsewhere in its online housing data, [Housing facts and figures 2004/2005 to 2021, Permissions and delivery of affordable homes](<Housing facts and figures 2004/2005 to 2021 Permissions and delivery of affordable homes>).
