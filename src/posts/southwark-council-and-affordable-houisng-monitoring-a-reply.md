Southwark Council have issued a self-congratulatory statement, ['Southwark Council takes action on affordable housing promies'](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2022/dec/southwark-council-takes-action-on-affordable-homes-promises#:~:text=21%20December%202022,fulfil%20their%20affordable%20housing%20commitments.) detailing its efforts to monitor the proper delivery of affordable housing, secured from new housing developments in the borough.

This follows two decisions from the local government ombudsman on complaints that there was no proper monitoring system in place.  The [first decision](https://www.35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf), in 2016, upheld the complaint; [ the second](https://www.lgo.org.uk/decisions/planning/other/21-009-646), in 2022, decided that enough had been  done to rememdy the situation and that Southwark now had an effective monitoring process.  The complaints were made by member of the 35% Campaign and we have blogged several times on the issue, [most recently after the second decision.](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ombudsman-rejects-affordable-housing-complaint-against-southwark/)

### Southwark's monitoring claims

Southwark says that it provides *'the most comprehensive set of data...in a very transparent online way'*, in advance of any borough in the country and that *'the council's planning enforcement team investigate'*, if information is missing or not supplied.

Southwark also make a couple of more surprising claims.  They say that they agreed *'wholeheartedly, with the complainant'*, who pointed out that there was no proper monitoring and that it was *'not acceptable for landlords and developers to deprove people in the borough of the housing they need'.*  This was not apparant back in 2015.  Southwark rejected the complaint, twice, before it was referred to the Ombudsman and only acknowledged that there was a monitoring problem under the pressure of his decision.

### Generous developers?

Southwark also claim that there has actually been more affordable housing built in the borough than was required from developers, through the legal s106 agreements that were a condition of planning consents.  The responsible cabinet member is quoted, using figures evidently from the 2022 Audit, saying that while 6,278 affordable homes were required from 188 consented developments, 7,754 had been provided and *'more specifically',* that *'over 1,300 units'* of social rented housing had been built *'exceeding what was required'* (figures for developments since 2002).

This happy outcome appears very unlikely, particularly as developers routinely declare that there schemes are unvaible as a way of diminishing their affordable housing obligations.  Taking INSERT DEVELOPEMENT EXAMPLE as an example (rule of thumb), the difference in the value between a free-market home and a social rented home is  £x, it would mean that developers will have gifted Southwark property to the value of £yyym, since 2002.

### Audit alarm bells should be ringing

The descrepancy between what was required by the consents and s106 agreements and what was delivered might be more plausibly explained by errors in the audit, particularly given that it completely at odds with what Southwark says elsewhere in its online housing data, [Housing facts and figures 2004/2005 to 2021, Permissions and delivery of affordable homes](<Housing facts and figures 2004/2005 to 2021 Permissions and delivery of affordable homes>).

The tables here say that 15,237 affordable homes were approved (and therefor required) since 2004, well over twice the number quoted in Southwark's latest statement about the audit.  Of these 9,770 were delivered, reduced 6,985 after demolitions were taken into account.

On social rent, the tables say that 9,050 unts were approved, 5,597 were completed, reduced to 2,820 after demolitions, around 600 units fewer than the 3,410 figure given in the audit.

If these tables are correct, then we are not getting more affordable and more social rented housing than we should be, as Southwark now claims; we are getting less and by a significant margin - about 36% below the numbers of affordable housing approved, 55% below that number, after taking demolitions are taken into account.   Looking at social housing specifically, we are getting 40% less than was approved, 69% below that number, when demolitions are taken into account.

### GLA schemes

200+ scehmes missing

### Enforcement

How many schemes have had enforcement actions?  What have been the outcomes?  How man over the seven yers since 2015? How many recent? 

### Rents

Also enforcing rents kept to target - examples (Southwark News - Gutenberg Court).  Now apparant high (extortionate) service charges are being allowed to get around target rents.

### Which is right - the audit or the tables?

Southwark claims that it now has the monitoring of affordable housing delivery in hand and than it is taking enforcement action when needed.

But the information it is supplying is contradictory.  Either the audit is correct of the tables are...

As we explained in our last blog this descrepancy, plus that in the number of schemes (GLA) was put to the Ombudsman; disappointingly he declined to investigate the points (quote)...figures and descrepancies
