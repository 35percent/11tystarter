Southwark Council have issued a self-congratulatory message, ['Southwark Council takes action on affordable housing promies'](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2022/dec/southwark-council-takes-action-on-affordable-homes-promises#:~:text=21%20December%202022,fulfil%20their%20affordable%20housing%20commitments.) detailing its efforts to monitor the proper delivery of affordable housing, secured from new housing developments in the borough.

This follows two decisions from the local government ombudsman on complaints that there was no proper monitoring system in place.  The [first decision](https://www.35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf), in 2016, upheld the complaint; [ the second](https://www.lgo.org.uk/decisions/planning/other/21-009-646), in 2022, decided that enough had been  done to rememdy the situation and that Southwark now had an effective monitoring process.  The complaints were made by member of the 35% Campaign and we have blogged several times on the issue, [most recently after the second decision.](https://www.35percent.org/posts/ombudsman-rejects-affordable-housing-complaint-against-southwark/)

### Southwark's monitoring efforts

Southwark says that it provides 'the most comprehensive set of data...in a very transparent online way', in advance of any borough in the country and that the council's planning enforcement team investigate, if information is missing or not supplied.
