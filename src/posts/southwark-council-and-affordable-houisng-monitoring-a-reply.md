Southwark Council have issued a self-congratulatory message, ['Southwark Council takes action on affordable housing promies'](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2022/dec/southwark-council-takes-action-on-affordable-homes-promises#:~:text=21%20December%202022,fulfil%20their%20affordable%20housing%20commitments.) detailing its efforts to monitor the proper delivery of affordable housing, secured from new housing developments in the borough.

This follows two decisions from the local government ombudsman on complaints that there was no proper monitoring.  The first decision, in 2016, upheld the complaint;  the second, in 2022, decided that enough had been  done to rememdy the situation and that there was now an effective monitoring process in place.  We blooged recently on the decision.
