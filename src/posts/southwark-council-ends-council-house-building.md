When Southwark Council recently [ended the ‘direct delivery’ of new council housing](https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/southwark/council-says-it-must-stop-building-its-own-homes-and-rely-on-developers-instead/), the main strand of its council house building programme, it also announced that 3,057 council homes had been started (up to May 2024), of which 1,486 were complete.

The figures were given in an update report to the Council Cabinet meeting on 22 July.  The report also says that 312 intermediate homes and 495 private homes are also under construction, with 134 intermediate and 130 private homes completed .  Southwark’s target was to have at least 2,500 council homes built or under construction by 2022.   It will now rely upon private developments to fulfil a 2013 pledge to build 11,000 new council homes by 2043.

#### Southwark demolish over 4,000 social rented homes

This is not the full picture though.  A London Tenant Federation’s analysis of the delivery and loss of social-rented homes in London found that 4,382 social rented homes had been demolished in Southwark, between 2012 and 2022. This is 19% of the 22,892 total number of social rent homes demolished in London over that decade.  Only one other borough had demolished more (Ealing – 4,986).  Nearly 70% of the total demolitions were in just seven boroughs, including Southwark.  (LTF table screenshot).

#### 1,486 council homes?

A close look at the list of council homes that accompanies the report shows…….

Inside Housing recently reported on figures supplied by Southwark Council in response to FOI requests.....

#### What we think – 50% must become the new minimum

We need a council house building programme because the private sector has failed to provide us with enough affordable housing.  According to the Southwark Plan 2022 only 8% of the borough’s households can afford free-market housing, yet 65% of the new housing on private developments is exactly that – free-market.

Southwark’s pledge to build 11,000 council homes was a laudable attempt to make up for this market failure.  To hope that the private sector will now take up the slack left by endiing direct delivery, with ‘development parnerships’ looks like wishful thinking.  The building industry’ problems that the two cabinet reports outline apply to the whole sector.  Developers will factor these into viability assessments, along with profit margins set by themselves, to deliver as little affordable and social rented housing as possible.

Southwark are the lead signatories in an appeal by 20 councils to the new Labour government for more housing support. Whether or not this succeeds private developers must also begin to pull their weight.  We have been stuck on a minimum 35% affordable housing requirement for too long.  Southwark and the Mayor also have a ‘strategic’ target of 50%.  They must start to make this a reality and demand 50% affordable housing on every new development. They could begin with the new Aylesham and the Borough Triangle developments proposed by Berkeley Homes (check ‘Homes’).  Together they will deliver 1,600 new homes.  Southwark must demand that 800 should be affordable, with 70% social rented, if there is to be any credible chance of the private sector finally giving us the affordable housing we need.

### Email text/other points

So, while direct delivery has provided 79% council homes, Monday’s report cautiously says that DAs could ‘enable’ only 50% affordable housing (which could, maybe, be 50% social rent - para 85)

DAs are a route that Southwark has already taken.  The table below is from a 2018 report and shows 10 DA developments with a delivery 47% social rent (NB if the sites have been completed – we haven’t checked). 

Key point is that Southwark will be using its own land for this, but whereas it could get nearly 80% c/h by direct delivery it looks like it will only get 50% with DA’s (if all the affordable housing is social rent).

Southwark is also taking a ‘portfolio’ approach to this, where some sites might be, say, 100% free-market, with greater proportions of affordable housing on other sites to compensate.  The obvious danger here is that affordable housing gets squeezed out, particularly if there are long timescales, over linked developments (the Aylesbury is a developer partnership development). 

Only the net increase in homes will be included in the delivery of 11,000 homes. Routes to 11,000 pg 05 – so Aylesbury homes should not be included?
Finance the first of our 2,500 new council homes through a Greater London Authority grant, other resources such as s106/RTB receipts, and the lifting of the HRA borrowing cap.  Routes to 11,000 pg 09
Start to build more homes for private sale and other tenures to help pay for new council homes
