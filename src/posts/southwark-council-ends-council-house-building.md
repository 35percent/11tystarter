Southwark Council has ended the ‘direct delivery’ of new council housing, the main strand of its council house building programme.  It will now rely upon private developments to fulfil its 2013 pledge to build 11,000 new council homes by 2043.

The decision was taken at the Council Cabinet meeting on 22 July, when two reports on the programme were considered.  The first report was an update on what has been built so far.  This says that 3,050 council homes have been started up to May 2024, of which 1,486 have been completed.  A further 312 intermediate homes and 495 private homes are also under construction, with 134 intermediate and 130 private homes completed .  Southwark’s target was to have at least 2,500 council homes built or under construction by 2022. 

#### Southwark demolish over 4,000 social rented homes

This is not the full picture though.  A London Tenant Federation’s analysis of the delivery and loss of social-rented homes in London found that 4,382 social rented homes had been demolished in Southwark, between 2012 and 2022. This is 19% of the 22,892 total number of social rent homes demolished in London over that decade.  Only one other borough had demolished more (Ealing – 4,986).  Nearly 70% of the total demolitions were in just seven boroughs, including Southwark.  (LTF table screenshot).

#### 1,486 council homes?

A close look at the list of council homes that accompanies the report shows…….

#### The cost of scrapping schemes

Inside Housing recently reported on figures supplied by Southwark Council in response to FOI requests.....

#### What we think – 50% must become the new minimum

We need a council house building programme because the private sector has failed to provide us with enough affordable housing.  According to the Southwark Plan 2022 only 8% of the borough’s households can afford free-market housing, yet 65% of the new housing on private developments is exactly that – free-market.

Southwark’s pledge to build 11,000 council homes was a laudable attempt to make up for this market failure.  To hope that the private sector will now take up the slack left by endiing direct delivery, with ‘development parnerships’ looks like wishful thinking.  The building industry’ problems that the two cabinet reports outline apply to the whole sector.  Developers will factor these into viability assessments, along with profit margins set by themselves, to deliver as little affordable and social rented housing as possible.
