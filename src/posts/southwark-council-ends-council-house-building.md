When Southwark Council recently [ended the ‘direct delivery’ of new council housing](https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/southwark/council-says-it-must-stop-building-its-own-homes-and-rely-on-developers-instead/), the main strand of its council house building programme, it also announced that 3,057 council homes had been started (up to May 2024), of which 1,486 were complete.

The figures were given in an [update report](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s121469/Report Southwarks New Homes Programme Update.pdf>) to the Council Cabinet meeting on 22 July.  The report also says that 312 intermediate homes and 495 private homes are under construction, with 134 intermediate and 130 private homes completed .  Southwark’s target was to have at least 2,500 council homes built or under construction by 2022.   It will now rely upon private developments to fulfil a 2013 pledge to build 11,000 new council homes by 2043.

#### Southwark demolish over 4,000 social rented homes

The figures reported for council homes built or started does not give the full picture though.  They take no account of the numbers that are being demolished and, according to a [London Tenant Federation (LTF) analysis](https://londontenants.org/publication/23000-social-rented-homes-were-demolished-in-london-over-the-last-ten-years-2012-2022/), Southwark is demolishing more council homes than any other London borough, bar one.

The LTF found that Southwark Council has demolished 4,382 social rented-homes between 2012 and 2022. This is 19% of the 22,892 total number of social rent homes demolished in London over that decade.  Only one other borough had demolished more (Ealing – 4,986).  Nearly 70% of the total demolitions were in just seven boroughs, including Southwark.  (LTF table screenshot)

#### The homes demolished on the Aylesbury FDS

A close look at the list homes built [under the council house building programme](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s121470/Appendix 1 Southwark Construction New homes programme scheme list.pdf>) that accompanies the update report supports the LTF analysis.  According to this appendix nearly 40% of the new social housing comes from just three estate regeneration sites, with substantial demolition of council housing – the Aylesbury, the Tustin and the Ledbury estates.

Two adjoining Aylesbury sites will deliver 581 council homes between them (FDS Package A and FDS Package B).  There will be a further 55 social rented units on FDS  Package C .  However, 692 homes were demolished on the FDS site to allow for this; 595 of these were council homes.

### Tustin On-site?

On the Tustin estate Bowness House, Heversham House, Kentmere House and Hillbeck Close are all earmarked for demolition.  This will [lose 202 council homes](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s107929/Report Tustin Estate land bounded by Manor Grove Ilderton Road Hillbeck Close Old Kent Road SE15.pdf>), with 355 social rent built in their place, giving an ‘uplift’ of 153 social rent homes . There will also be 115 intermediate and 220 free market homes, giving a total of 690.

But while the scheme is described as being ‘on site’, this is only practically true of Phase 1 of the four-phase development.    An examination of Southwark’s planning register shows that while all the phases have an outline planning permission, only [Phase 1 has a full detailed planning permission](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=64449). Phases 2, 3 and 4 still need these vital approvals.  Most of the 690 new homes will be delivered on these later phases (523 homes); Phase 1 will deliver 167 units, including 157 ‘affordable’ homes. 

The Tustin regeneration was approved by residents by ballot and will provide more and better quality social rented housing.  But counting them all now and without taking account of the social housing lost is inaccurate and premature.

### Ledbury estate

#### What's wrong with s106 purchases?

As well as the estate regeneration schemes, Southwark has included 252 social rented homes and 26 intermediate homes bought from private developers.  These come from four developments - the giant Canada Water development (Plot K1; Salter Rd, Blocks C,E,F); Sylvan Grove, Old Kent Road; Dibdin Appartments (128 – 150 Blackfriars Road); 1-5 Odessa Street SE16.  This is affordable housing that has been provided under s106 legal agreements with the Council, as an obligation attached to a planning approval.

These affordable units increase the amount of affordable housing in the borough and are vital to increasing social housing, in the absence of enough council-built social housing.  They are usually bought from private developers by housing associations, though, not local councils.  There is therefore no net increase in social rented housing when they are bought by the local authority, because they would have been social rent homes anyway, albeit with housing association landlords, not council landlords.  Southwark is also using resources that could be used to build or maintain truly additional social rented housing, on top of what developers have to provide in any event.

Southwark also includes 57 social rented homes in the New Almshouse, 94-116 Southwark Park Road, otherwise known as [Appleby Blue](https://www.ustsc.org.uk/almshouses/new-almshouse/).  These are attactive, well-designed new homes, owned by charity Unitied St Saviours for over-65s, who have lived at least 3 years in Southwark and are in owned by charity [United St Saviours](https://www.ustsc.org.uk/),   A minimum of three years’ residency in Southwark.\

### The cost of scrapping schemes

Inside Housing recently reported on figures supplied by Southwark Council in response to FOI requests.....

<https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/exclusive-three-london-councils-scrapped-at-least-240m-worth-of-social-housing-last-year-87902 >

### The upshot....

If the demolitions we have noted above are taken into account it means that Southwark's council housing programme has xxxxx council homes either onsite or completed, not 3,057.  It also reduces the number actually completed from 1,486 to yyyy.

If the s106 purchases are also discounted then the number of council homes onsite or completed is reduced further to xxxxxx and the number completed to yyyyy.

This does not take into account big loses of council housing elswhere eg on th Heygate and Silwood estates.

Southwark’s pledge to build 11,000 council homes was a laudable attempt to make up for a market failure, but it is boosting the figures in a way which just disguises the fact that it has been running just to stand still and now that it has ended direct delivery......what?

### What we think – 50% must become the new minimum

We need a council house building programme because the private sector has failed to provide us with enough affordable housing.  According to the Southwark Plan 2022 only 8% of the borough’s households can afford free-market housing, yet 65% of the new housing on private developments is exactly that – free-market.

Southwark’s pledge to build 11,000 council homes was a laudable attempt to make up for this market failure.  To hope that the private sector will now take up the slack left by endiing direct delivery, with ‘development parnerships’ looks like wishful thinking.  The building industry’ problems that the two cabinet reports outline apply to the whole sector.  Developers will factor these into viability assessments, along with profit margins set by themselves, to deliver as little affordable and social rented housing as possible.

Southwark are the lead signatories in an appeal by 20 councils to the new Labour government for more housing support. Whether or not this succeeds private developers must also begin to pull their weight.  We have been stuck on a minimum 35% affordable housing requirement for too long.  Southwark and the Mayor also have a ‘strategic’ target of 50%.  They must start to make this a reality and demand 50% affordable housing on every new development. They could begin with the new Aylesham and the Borough Triangle developments proposed by Berkeley Homes (check ‘Homes’).  Together they will deliver 1,600 new homes.  Southwark must demand that 800 should be affordable, with 70% social rented, if there is to be any credible chance of the private sector finally giving us the affordable housing we need.

### Email text/other points

So, while direct delivery has provided 79% council homes, Monday’s report cautiously says that DAs could ‘enable’ only 50% affordable housing (which could, maybe, be 50% social rent - para 85)

DAs are a route that Southwark has already taken.  The table below is from a 2018 report and shows 10 DA developments with a delivery 47% social rent (NB if the sites have been completed – we haven’t checked). 

Key point is that Southwark will be using its own land for this, but whereas it could get nearly 80% c/h by direct delivery it looks like it will only get 50% with DA’s (if all the affordable housing is social rent).

Southwark is also taking a ‘portfolio’ approach to this, where some sites might be, say, 100% free-market, with greater proportions of affordable housing on other sites to compensate.  The obvious danger here is that affordable housing gets squeezed out, particularly if there are long timescales, over linked developments (the Aylesbury is a developer partnership development). 

Only the net increase in homes will be included in the delivery of 11,000 homes. Routes to 11,000 pg 05 – so Aylesbury homes should not be included?
