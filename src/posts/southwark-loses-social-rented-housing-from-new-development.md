Southwark Council has declined to take any action to recover nine social rented homes that have been lost from Gutenberg Court, a housing development in Grange Rd.  Southwark Law Centre made a formal complaint in October 2021 that homes were being advertised on the Council's Homesearch website at over twice the average social rent levels.   After a lengthy delay the Council have now replied that it will not be taking any enforcement action (image).

Gutenberg Court was given planning permission by the Council in July 2011.  The [officer's report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) states that the 38 units development would include nine units of social rented housing.  The applicant's planning statement for the development also says that there will be nine social rented units.

## Council fails to enforce affordable housing requirement

 The Council, however, say that the s106 agreement between themselves and the developer, which should say how much affordable housing a new scheme delivers, has *'unfortunately...no secific requirement ...to provide affordable housing to be let on social rent terms.'* and *'we have therefore concluded that there is no clear breach of the section 106 agreement and no basis for enforcement action...'.*   The Council says that the matter has been raised with the Housing Association ([PA (Paragon Asra) Housing](https://www.pahousing.co.uk/)) but that they are *'not willing to alter the status because they are complying with the terms of this agreement'.* 

The Council do not say why the nine social rented units are not in the s106 agreement.  Instead they point to a recent Local Government Ombudsman decision that says it has a proper affordable housing monitoring system in place and that the system shows that the borough has received over 1400 more social rented units from developers than s106 agreements require.

### Public funding at stake

The Mayor of London's grant funding database shows that Gutenberg Court was awarded a total of £386k grant funding from the Mayor's Affordable Housing Fund for the 13 affordable homes, at a time when the development's housing association was known as Leicester Housing Association. This raises a question of whether  the Mayor has been properly monitoring the delivery of social housing he is paying for. 

A further question arises around the price paid for the affordable units. Land Registry documents show that the housing assocation paid the developer £650k for 14 homes.  If nine of these were to be let at market related rents, not social rents, then the price would probably have been greater, improving the viability of the scheme and the scope for additional affordable housing.

### Some questions for Southwark Council

Gutenberg Court is one of seven developments that the Southwark Law Centre's Planning Voice project raised with Southwark Council, where the [social rents appear higher](https://www.35percent.org/posts/southwarks-new-developments-that-fail-to-deliver-social-rent/) than they should be.  The Council's limp response effectively concedes that the nine social rented homes promised for Gutenberg Court have not been delivered; what is worse, the Council makes it clear that they intend to do nothing further to retrieve them.  We suggest that if the housing association involved does not reduce the nine Gutenberg Court homes to social rent levels, then it should not be allowed any involvement in future housing developments in the borough.

Southwark must also explain why *'unfortunately'* the promise of nine social rented units did not find its way into the s106 agreement, the key document in any planning permission.  Southwark planning was obviously not paying proper attention to the s106 wording and nine social rented units have been lost through this carelessness.

Southwark should also explain why it took no action until it received a complaint from Southwark Law Centre. When its own audits noted the discrepancy with the comment: *"9x Social Rent units delivered as Affordable Rent."* This should have prompted immediate action. Affordable rent can be up to 80% market rent and is not considered a suitable tenure for Southwark according to the Council's own website.

Instead of addressing these points, though, Southwark hides behind the Ombudsman's decision (link) that a monitoring system is in place and that this shows that private developers have delivered over 1400 (check) more social units than they should have.

There is a simpler explanation for this 1400 figure, though, and that is that the audit is flawed, as Guttenberg Court demonstrates.  The audit depends upon accurate returns from many housing associations, big and small and if the figures do not add up that requires a better explanation than 'we are getting more social housing than we thought'.  Southwark should identify this 'extra' social housing by address, to be sure it is social housing, let at social rents, and no just an accumulation of errors and inaccurate reports.

### Southwark Law Centre's Planning Voice says...

*'Given the desperate need for social rented housing in Southwark, the lack of action Southwark Council has taken from its own affordable housing audits’ findings and the lack of attention to detail from Southwark Planning regarding the writing of the S106 agreement is worrying. We are concerned that Southwark Council has not explained why the social rented units are not in the S106 agreement of Gutenberg Court and have rather pointed towards their affordable housing monitoring system to which they do not seem to be taking immediate action for the discrepancies arising from this. 
There are thousands of families who are in dire need of housing at social rent levels, when social housing is promised, its vital that it is delivered'.*
