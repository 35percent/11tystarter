Southwark Council has declined to take any action to recover nine social rented homes that have been lost from Gutenberg Court, a housing development in Grange Rd.  Southwark Law Centre made a formal complaint in October 2021 that two of the homes were being advertised on the Council's Homesearch website at above social rent levels in October 2021.   After a lengthy delay the Council have now replied that it will not be taking any enforcement action (image).

Gutenberg Court was given planning permission by the Council in July 2011.  The [officer's report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) states that the 31 units development would include nine units of social rented housing.  The applicant's planning statement for the development also says that there will be nine social rented units.

 The Council, however, say that the s106 agreement between themselves and the developer, which that should say how much affordable housing a new scheme delivers, has *'unfortunately...no secific requirement ...to provide affordable housing to be let on social rent terms.'* and *'we have therefore concluded that there is not clear breach of the section 106 agreement and no basis for enforcement action...'.*   The Council says that the matter has been raised with the Housing Association ([PA (Paragon Asra) Housing](https://www.pahousing.co.uk/)) but that they are *'not willing to alter the status because they are complying with the terms of this agreement'.* 

The Council do not say why the nine social rented units are not in the s106 agreement.  Instead they point to a recent Local Government Ombudsman decision that it has a proper affordable housing monitoring system in place and that this shows that the borough has received over 1400 more social rented units from developers than s106 agreements require.

### What we say 

Gutenberg Court is one of seven developments that the Southwark Law Centre's Planning Voice project raised with Southwark Council, where the [social rents appear higher](https://www.35percent.org/posts/southwarks-new-developments-that-fail-to-deliver-social-rent/) than they should be.  The Council's limp response effectively concedes that the eleven social rented homes promised for Gutenberg Court have not been delivered; what is worse, the Council makes it clear that they intends to do nothing further to try to retrieve them.  We suggest that if the housing association involved does not let nine homes at social rents, when it is clear th then it certainly
