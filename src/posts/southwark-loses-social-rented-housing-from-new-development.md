Southwark Council has declined to take any action to recover nine social rented homes that have been lost from Gutenberg Court, a housing development in Grange Rd.  Southwark Law Centre made a formal complaint in October 2021 that two of the homes were being advertised on the Council's Homesearch website at above social rent levels in October 2021.   After a lengthy delay the Council have now replied that it will not be taking any enforcement action (image).

Gutenberg Court was given planning permission by the Council in July 2011.  The [officer's report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) states that the 38 units development would include nine units of social rented housing.  The applicant's planning statement for the development also says that there will be nine social rented units.

 The Council, however, say that the s106 agreement between themselves and the developer, which should say how much affordable housing a new scheme delivers, has *'unfortunately...no secific requirement ...to provide affordable housing to be let on social rent terms.'* and *'we have therefore concluded that there is not clear breach of the section 106 agreement and no basis for enforcement action...'.*   The Council says that the matter has been raised with the Housing Association ([PA (Paragon Asra) Housing](https://www.pahousing.co.uk/)) but that they are *'not willing to alter the status because they are complying with the terms of this agreement'.* 

The Council do not say why the nine social rented units are not in the s106 agreement.  Instead they point to a recent Local Government Ombudsman decision that it has a proper affordable housing monitoring system in place and that this shows that the borough has received over 1400 more social rented units from developers than s106 agreements require.

### Some questions for Southwark Council

Gutenberg Court is one of seven developments that the Southwark Law Centre's Planning Voice project raised with Southwark Council, where the [social rents appear higher](https://www.35percent.org/posts/southwarks-new-developments-that-fail-to-deliver-social-rent/) than they should be.  The Council's limp response effectively concedes that the nine social rented homes promised for Gutenberg Court have not been delivered; what is worse, the Council makes it clear that they intend to do nothing further to retrieve them.  We suggest that if the housing association involved does not now let nine Gutenberg Court homes at social rents, when that is what was promised, then it should not be allowed any involvement in future housing developments in the borough.

Southwark must also explain why *'unfortunately'* the promise of nine social rented units did not find its way into the s106 agreement, the key document in any planning permission.  A charitable explanation is that the planning department was not paying proper attention to the s106 wording, but we cannot afford such carelessness, when the need for social rented homes is so desperate.

Soutwark should also explain why they themselves did not discover that the absent social units in their own audits.  Gutenberg Court is listed in the 2021 (?check) audit as returning 10 affordable rent and 3 shared-ownership units (check), not nine social rent and two shared-ownership.

Instead of addressing these points, though, Southwark hides behind the Ombudsman's decision (link) that a monitoring system is in place and that this shows that private developers have delivered over 1400 (check) more social units than they should have.

There is a simpler explanation for this 1400 figure, though, and that is that the audit is flawed, as Guttenberg Court demonstrates.  The audit depends upon accurate returns from many housing associations, big and small and if the figures do not add up that requires a better explanation than 'we are getting more social housing than we thought'.  Southwark should identify this 'extra' social houisng by adress, tobe sure it is social housing, let at social rents, and no just an accumulation of errors and inaccurate reports.
