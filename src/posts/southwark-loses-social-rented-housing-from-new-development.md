Southwark Council has declined to take any action to recover nine social rented homes that have been lost from Gutenberg Court, a housing development in Grange Rd.  Southwark Law Centre made a formal complaint that two of the homes were being advertised for let at above social rent levels in October 2021, on the Council's Homesearch website.   The Council have now replied that it will not be taking any enforcement action (image).

Gutenberg Court was given planning permission by the Council in July 2011.  The [officer's report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) states that the 31 units development would include nine units of social rented housing.  The applicant's planning statement for the development also says that there will be nine social rented units.

 The Council, however, say that the s106 agreement between themselves and the developer, which that should say how much affordable housing a new scheme delivers, has *'unfortunately...no secific requirement ...to provide affordable housing to be let on social rent terms.'* and *'we have therefore concluded that there is not clear breach of the section 106 agreement and no basis for enforcement action...'.*   The Council says that the matter has been raised with the Housing Association ([PA (Paragon Asra) Housing](https://www.pahousing.co.uk/)) but that they are *'not willing to alter the status because they are complying with the terms of this agreement'.*
