Social rented housing with rents above the limits set by government have begun appearing on Southwark's Homeseach website.  The website is used by people on the housing waiting list to find a new home.  Nearly all the homes come from new private developments that have been approved on the condition that a proportion of the housing is social rented.  

[The Southwark Law Centre's](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/) Planning Voice project has been monitoring Homesearch for the past year and has raised the issue with the Council.  It has written to them with eight examples, seven of which have rent levels above [the formula rent cap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rent-standard/limit-on-annual-rent-increases-2022-23-from-april-2022) limits set by government; by contrast the eighth development, Adrian Court, built by Southwark Council, has social rents at just about the correct levels.

The developments identified include Elephant Park, in the site of the former Heygate estate, and three where the social housing is delivered by the same registered provider, Optivo.  SCREENSHOT OF RENT CAP TABLE, also RENT TABLE, GRAPHIC?

The seven private develpments are; 44 Willow Walk, Eden House, Shirley Chissom Court, Dockley Apartments, Gutenberg Court, Elephant Park and Joseph Lancaster Terrace.  All the rents in these schemes exceed the the rent cap by various amounts, both with and without weekly service charges. 

### Optivo's big social rents

In Eden House, Optivo charge a total of £281.54pw, including a £12.35 service charge, against a rent cap of £269.19 rent, for a two-bed flat.  The total rent for a one-bed in Shirley Chisholm Court is £184.03, including £15.69 service charge, against a rent cap of £155.73.  In Dockley Apartments the rents for one and two bed flats are at the rent cap limit of £155.73 and £164.87, but with large service charges added the total rents payable are £189.03 (rent cap £155.73) and £210.73 (rent cap £164.87) respectively.

### Rent and service charges - Peabody and Paragon

Some of the scheme's providers do not show any service charge in the total weekly rent.  Peabody are charging total rents of £223.50 (rent cap £155.73) one-bed and £248.72 (rent cap £164.87) two-bed at Willow Walk.  Paragon and Asra Housing Ltd are charging £261.44 for a one-bed and £295.40 for a two bed at Gutenberg Court (LINK). Our last blog post showed how the nine social rented units that were approved at planning committee have been audited as intermediate, or affordable rent, red flagged, but with apparantly no enforcement action to date.

### L&Q at Elephant Park

L&Q provides the affordable housing on Elephant Park, including one hundred 3-bed social rented units.  L&Q are charging below the rent cap for rents, but then adding very large service charges, to take total rents up to at least £213.43pw, against a rent cap of £174.03.  The latest flats advertised in Robeson Apts, Rodney Place are a whopping £281.20pw.

The level of social rents was [raised by objectors](https://southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing/fears-raised-that-100-elephant-park-social-rent-properties-are-charging-tenants-incorrectly/) at the planning committee meeting that rejected Lendlease's proposal to build an office block on Elephant Park.  Southwark have also started [an enforcement action](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/enforcementDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=RELD9TKB00K01) for an audit of the rents of Elephant Park's Sandow House.  This was due to be concluded by 21 September, but remains pending.

### Southwark Council and Adrian Court

The social rents being charged for Southwark's new council homes on Adrian Court stand in stark contrast to those of the registered providers listed above.  The one, two bed units are all being let at below the rent cap level, and the three-bed at just above, all rents including a flat service charge of £10.29.

### Conclusion - effective monitoring

Southwark Law Centre's intervention comes just after the Local Goverment and Social Care Ombudsman ruled that Southwark had an effective monitoring system for the delivery of affordable and social rented housing.  The size of these rents tell a different story.  Registered providers are labelling homes as social rented, but charging rents above the rent cap and then adding wildly varying service charges on top.  To its credit, Southwark does not seem to be doing this, with the result that what the social tenant can pay for the same sized flat is dramatic - a three-bed  on Southwark's Adrian Court costing £174.03 incl, whereas the same on Elephant Park can costs £281.20. 

it should not need saying that what counts for the tenant is the total amount that they have to find at the end of th week, whether it is called 'rent' or 'servive charge' is irrelevant from this point of view.
