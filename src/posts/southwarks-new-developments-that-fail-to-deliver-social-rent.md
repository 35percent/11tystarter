Social rented housing with rents above the rent limits set by government have begun appearing on Southwark's Homeseach website.  The website is used to bid for a new home by people on the housing waiting list.  All the homes come from private new developments that have been approved on the condition that a given amount of social rented housing is also built.  

[The Southwark Law Centre's](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/) Planning Voice project has been monitoring Homesearch for the past year and has raised the issue with the Council.  It has written to them with eight examples, seven of which have rent levels above [the formula rent cap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rent-standard/limit-on-annual-rent-increases-2022-23-from-april-2022) limits set by government; by contrast the eighth development, Adrian Court, built by Southwark Council, has social rents at just about the correct levels.

The developments identified include Elephant Park, in the site of the former Heygate estate, and three where the social housing is delivered by the same registered provider, Optivo.  SCREENSHOT OF RENT CAP TABLE, also RENT TABLE, GRAPHIC?

The seven private develpments are; 44 Willow Walk, Eden House, Shirley Chissom Court, Dockley Apartments, Gutenberg Court, Elephant Park and Joseph Lancaster Terrace.  All the rents in these schemes exceed the the rent cap by various amounts, both with and without weekly service charges. 

### Optivo's big social rents

In Eden House, Optivo charge £269.19 rent for a two-bed flat, against a rent cap of £168.87, with an added £12.35 service charge, giving a total of £281.54pw, against a rent cap of £164.87.  The total rent for a one-bed in Shirley Chisholm Court is £184.03, including £15.69 service charge

### Conclusion - effective monitoring

Southwark law Centre's intervention comes just after the Local Goverment and Social Care Ombudsman ruled that Southwark had an effective monitoring system for the delivery of affordable and social rented housing.  The size of these rents tell a different story.  Registered providers are labelling homes as social rented, but charging rents above the rent cap and then adding wildly varying service charges on top.  To its credit Southwark does not seem to be doing this, with the result that what the social tenant can pay for te same sized flat is dramatic - a three-bed  on Southwark's Adrian Court costing £174.03 incl, whereas the same on Elephant Park can costs £281.20.
