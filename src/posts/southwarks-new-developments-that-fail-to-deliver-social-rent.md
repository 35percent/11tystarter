Social rented housing with rents above the rent limits set by government have begun appearing on Southwark's Homeseach website.  The website is used by those on the housing waiting list to bid for new homes.  All the homes come from private new developments that have been approved on the condition that a given amount of social rented housing is also built.  

The Southwark Law Centre's Planning Voice project has been monitoring Homesearch for the past year and has raised the issue with the Council.  It has written to them with eight examples, seven of which have rent levels above the limit set by government - [the formula rent cap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rent-standard/limit-on-annual-rent-increases-2022-23-from-april-2022); by contrast the eighth development, built by Southwark Council, has social rents at just about the correct levels.
