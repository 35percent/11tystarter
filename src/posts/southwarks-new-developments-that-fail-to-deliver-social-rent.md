Social rented housing with rents above the rent limits set by government have begun appearing on Southwark's Homeseach website.  The website is used to bid for a new home by people on the housing waiting list.  All the homes come from private new developments that have been approved on the condition that a given amount of social rented housing is also built.  

[The Southwark Law Centre's](https://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/) Planning Voice project has been monitoring Homesearch for the past year and has raised the issue with the Council.  It has written to them with eight examples, seven of which have rent levels above [the formula rent cap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rent-standard/limit-on-annual-rent-increases-2022-23-from-april-2022) limits set by government; by contrast the eighth development, Adrian Court, built by Southwark Council, has social rents at just about the correct levels.

The developments identified include Elephant Park, in the site of the former Heygate estate, and three where the social housing is delivered by the same registered provider, Optivo.  SCREENSHOT OF TABLE

The seven private develpments are; 44 Willow Walk, Eden House, Shirley Chissom Court, Dockley Apartments, Gutenberg Court, Elephant Park and Joseph Lancaster Terrace.  All the rents in these schemes exceed the the rent cap by various amounts, both with and without weekly service charges.
